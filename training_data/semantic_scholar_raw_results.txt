Venus is the ultimate control case for understanding how Earth developed and maintained conditions suited to life. Venus very likely had elements essential to habitability such as past surface water and a dynamo. Tectonism and volcanism, which create chemical disequilibrium, very likely persist today. What caused Earth and Venus to diverge down different evolutionary paths? VERITAS would create foundational, co-registered data sets of high-resolution topography, imaging, spectroscopy, and gravity, on par with those available for Mercury, Mars, and the Moon. VERITAS would answer outstanding fundamental questions about the evolution of Earth's twin. The VERITAS payload consists of the Venus Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (VISAR) and the Venus Emissivity Mapper (VEM), plus a gravity science investigation. VISAR is an X-band radar that provides: 1) a global digital elevation model (DEM) with 250-m postings and 6-m height accuracy, 2) Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging at 30-m horizontal resolution globally, 3) SAR imaging at 15-m resolution for $> \\boldsymbol{25\\%}$ of the surface, and 4) surface deformation from repeat pass interferometry (RPI) with 2-cm vertical precision for $> \\boldsymbol{12} \\boldsymbol{(\\sim 200\\ \\mathrm{x}\\ 200\\ \\text{km})}$ targeted areas. VEM covers $\\boldsymbol{ > 70\\%}$ of the surface in six near-infrared (NIR) bands sensitive to iron composition located within five atmospheric windows, plus eight atmospheric bands for calibration and water vapor measurements. VEM would provide near-global maps of mafic to felsic rock type and will search for active and recent volcanism. VERITAS would use two-way Ka-band uplink and downlink from a low circular orbit $\\boldsymbol{(< 250\\ \\text{km})}$ to create a global gravity field with 3-mGal accuracy of 155-km resolution (degree and order 123). An onboard technology demonstration, the Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC-2), may support radio science and navigation with one-way tracking. VERITAS data would enable estimation of elastic thickness (a proxy for thermal gradient) and density differences due to subsurface structures, as well as constraining interior structure, including core size and state. Lockheed Martin builds the spacecraft. VISAR is built by JPL, with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) providing the low power electronics. ASI also provides transponders and a high gain antenna for the telecom system. CNES provides the Ka-band traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA). The German Space Agency (DLR) provides VEM and contributes algorithms for VISAR ground and onboard data processing."}, {"paperId": "00349f6857d7def7b1080653c1a70176a612aff3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00349f6857d7def7b1080653c1a70176a612aff3", "title": "Change Point Analysis as a Tool to Detect Abrupt Cosmic Ray Muons Variations", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The WAI consists of two identical cameras, each with an FOV of 68\u00b0 in the along-track direction and 10\u00b0 in the cross-track direction. The two cameras are tilted relative to each other to cover a fan-shaped field of size 130\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b0. Each camera consists of an unobstructed four-mirror anastigmatic optical system, a BaF2 filter, and a photon-counting imaging detector. The spatial resolution of WAI is ~10\u2009km at the nadir point at a reference height of 110\u2009km above the Earth\u2019s surface. The sensitivity is >0.01\u2009counts\u2009s\u22121\u2009Rayleigh\u22121\u2009pixel\u22121 (140\u2013180\u2009nm) for both cameras, which is sufficient for mapping the boundaries and the fine structures of the auroral oval during storms/substorms. Based on the tests and calibrations that were conducted prior to launch, the data processing algorithm includes photon signal decoding, geometric distortion correction, photometric correction, flat-field correction, line-of-sight projection and correction, and normalization between the two cameras. Preliminarily processed images are compared with DMSP SSUSI images. The agreement between the images that were captured by two instruments demonstrates that the WAI and the data processing algorithm operate normally and can provide high-quality scientific data for future studies on auroral dynamics. A compact camera system on board China\u2019s recently launched Fengyun-3D satellite can reveal subtle features of the Earth\u2019s auroras for improved space weather forecasting. Auroras such as the northern lights arise when solar wind charged particles precipitate along the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and collide with atmospheric gases. Xiao-Xin Zhang, Bo Chen and their colleagues have developed a high-resolution imager that can help researchers predict geomagnetic substorms and storms from the dynamic configurations of auroras. The imager uses two cameras to simultaneously scan auroral regions from a low Earth orbit, delivering an expanded field of view relative to previous instruments. In-orbit testing shows that the device\u2019s mirror-based optics and data processing system can identify boundaries and structures of auroras with 10 kilometer-scale resolution."}, {"paperId": "005f3d64207206000e874bb66189d1b67020e014", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005f3d64207206000e874bb66189d1b67020e014", "title": "CHARACTERIZING CARBON-DIOXIDE FLUXES FROM OCEANS AND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

These GHGs viz. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and surface and thus raise the atmospheric temperature. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC), in its Fifth Assessment Report, has reiterated that warming of the climatic system is International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 7 Number 02 (2018) Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com India has been able to produce enough to feed its 1.25 + billion As well as export food grains to other countries. But the challenge to feed a Projected population of1.6 billion in 2050 and provide them with nutrition Security, is a formidable one because of the continuously degrading natural resource base and shrinking of good agriculture land for cultivation, It has been estimated that to meet the demands of that vast population, land productivity has to be enhanced four times along with three fold increase is water productivity and concomitant increase of six times in labour productivity. The era of Anthropocene has been endorsed by both climatic and non\u2013climatic factors. It may increase the risk of food and water security across the globe. Among all, carbon (C) sequestration is one of the important strategies that could mitigate the effect of climate change to some extent by transferring atmospheric CO2\u2013C into the longlive natural pools such as soils and perennial green biomass. Soil organic carbon (SOC) has relation in plant growth and agronomic productivity Most of the soils of India have been depleted their SOC stocks. Further, changes in climate are exacerbating the risk of soil erosion and alter nutrient cycling, and thereby impacting optimization of crop production. Therefore, conservation of sol organic matter (SOM) is essential to prevent soils from further degradation and for overall soil health maintenance. This article focuses climate change impact on agriculture, C Sequestration and their role on vice-VERSA. The strategies for C sink (efficient use of crop residue, conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, agroforestry, cover crop, use of organic and other bio-solids etc.) along with soil C which will have marked influence on sustainable crop production and impart climate resilience.

The anthropogenic influence on the climatic system is evident from the increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere and the positive radiative forcing. As a result, the temperature atmosphere and ocean is going up, snow and ice are melting fast, and sea level is of rising. This global climate change will have considerable impact on the crop, soil, livestock and fishery. Agriculture engages almost two-third of the workforce in gainful employment and accounts for a significant share in India\u2019s gross domestic product. Several industries depend on agricultural production for their requirement of raw materials. Due to its close linkages with other economic sectors, agricultural growth has a multiplier effect on the entire economy of the country. The agricultural sector is believed to contribute to the greenhouse effect and the ensuring climate change is likely to have adverse impact on this sector, Various agricultural activities such as land clearing, cultivation of crops, irrigation, animal husbandry, fisheries and aquaculture have a significant impact on the emission of GHGs and consequently on climate change (IPCC, 2014). An in-depth understanding of trends in emission of GHGs, their driver, and the relation between the two, is essential for comprehending the need for mitigation and adaptation. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate the emission of GHGs from Indian agriculture, analyze the drivers and trends of GHG emission and assess the potential of various mitigation options. Agriculture as a source and sink of GHG Agriculture contributes to greenhouse effect primarily through the emission and consumption of GHGs such as CH4, N2O and CO2, CH4 is produced in soil during microbial decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Rice fields submerged underwater are the potential sources of CH4 production. Continuous submerged, higher organic C content and use of organic manure in Puddled soil enhance CH4 emission. Burning of crop residues also contributes to the global methane budget. The enteric fermentation in ruminants is another major source of CH4 emission. Nitrous oxide is produced in soils through the processes of nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification is the aerobic microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate, and denitrification is the anaerobic microbial of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2) Nitrous oxide is a gaseous intermediate in the reaction sequence of denitrification and a byproduct of nitrification that leaks from microbial cells into the soil and ultimately into the atmosphere. One of the main controlling factors in this reaction is the availability of inorganic N in soil through additions of synthetic or organic fertilizers, manure, crop residues, sewage sludge or mineralization of N in soil organic matter following drainage/ management of organic soil and cultivation / lands-use change on mineral soils. The main source of carbon dioxide in agriculture is tillage, which triggers emission of this gas though biological decomposition of soil organic matter. Tillage breaks the soil aggregates, increases the oxygen supply and exposes the surface area of organic material promoting the decomposition of organic matter. Use of fuel for various agricultural operations and burning of crop residues are the other sources of carbon dioxide emission. An off-site source is the manufacturing of farm implements, fertilizers and pesticides. Climate change is becoming a serious global environmental concern. The signatures of climate change, have been seen in every sphere of life on the earth which ignited the issues towards set back free and eco-friendly environment. The climate has been changing Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2018) 7(2): 1668-1673 1670 naturally as volcanoes, tectonic plate movements since the beginning of time. Recently it is in the news due to anthropogenic emissions and man-made disturbances. Concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere exceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40, 150 and 20% in 2011 CO2, CH4, N2O, Respectively. The current total global anthropogenic emission is estimated at 400 ppm (WMO, 2013). It was expected that increase in atmospheric CO2 has a fertilization effect on crops through carbon(C) assimilation pathway and thus may encourage crop growth and productivity (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2016). On the other hand, increase in temperature could reduce crop growth and periods, alter photosynthetic processes, and affect pest populations, nutrient loss in soils. The transfer of C in the green biomass and its sink into the soils is one of the most important strategies to address the problem of land degradation and climate change mitigation. Secondly, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere can be minimised by reducing the global energy use or through the substitution of fossil fuels by biomass and sequesteringCO2 in soils and biomass (Schrag, 2007). SOC refers to containing C in SOM; hence, conservation and agricultural soils have list 30 to 75% of their antecedent SOC pool (Lal et al., 2007). Agricultural, forest and other landuse change (AFOLU) contributes less than 25% (~10-12 Gt CO2 eq/year) of anthropogenic GHG emission. Long-term experiments are important for assessing long-term changes in SIC and crop yields and estimating C sequestration potential of agricultural lands (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2013).

The current uncertainty in climate projections is partly due to the inaccurate representation of aerosol direct and indirect forcing. Aerosol/chemistry parameterizations used within ESMs and other atmospheric models span large structural and parameter uncertainties which are difficult to assess independently of their host models. Moreover, there is a strong need for a standardized interface between aerosol/chemistry modules and the host model to facilitate portability of aerosol/chemistry parameterizations from one model to another, allowing not only a comparison between different parameterizations within the same modeling framework, but also quantifying the impact of different model frameworks on aerosol/chemistry predictions. To address this need, we have initiated a new community effort to coordinate the construction of a GeneralIzed Aerosol/chemistry iNTerface (GIANT) for use across weather and climate models. We aim to organize a series of community workshops and Hack-a-thons to design and build GIANT which will serve as the interface between a range of aerosol/chemistry modules and the physics and dynamics components of atmospheric host models. GIANT will leverage ongoing efforts at the U.S. modeling centers focused on building next-generation ESMs and the international AeroCom initiative to implement this common aerosol/chemistry interface. GIANT will create transformative opportunities for scientists and students to conduct innovative research to better characterize structural and parametric uncertainties in aerosol/chemistry modules, and to develop a common set of aerosol/chemistry parameterizations."}, {"paperId": "00fdd7c0691d43a8eb970b40c70e2910a3e37436", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00fdd7c0691d43a8eb970b40c70e2910a3e37436", "title": "A global decadal mode in a high-end climate model and in observations:\u00a0Any connection to the solar cycle?", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-4961?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-4961, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Interannual oscillatory modes, atmospheric and oceanic, are present in several large regions of the globe. We examine here interannual-to-decadal variability over the entire globe in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, and apply multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) to these two datasets.</p><p>In the fully coupled CESM1.1 model, with its resolution of 0.1 &#215; 0.1 degrees in the ocean and 0.25 &#215; 0.25 degrees in the atmosphere, the &#64257;elds analyzed are surface temperatures, sea level pressures and&#160; the 200-hPa geopotential. The simulation is 100-yr long and the last 66 yr are used in the analysis. The two statistically signi&#64257;cant periodicities in this IPCC-class model are 11 and 3.4 yr.</p><p>In the reanalysis, the &#64257;elds of sea level pressure and of 200-hPa geopotential are analyzed at its resolution of 2.5 &#215; 2.5 degrees over the 68-yr interval 1949&#8211;2016. Oscillations with periods of 12 and 3.6 yr are found to be statistically signi&#64257;cant in this dataset. The spatio-temporal patterns&#160; of the oscillations in the two datasets are quite similar. The spatial pattern of these&#160; global oscillations over the North Paci&#64257;c and North Atlantic resemble the Paci&#64257;c Decadal Oscillation and the interannual variability found in the western North Atlantic, respectively.</p><p>The two global modes, with their 11&#8211;12-yr and 3.4&#8211;3.6-yr periodicities, are quite robust, suggesting potential contributions of both to predictability at 1&#8211;3-yr horizons. On the other hand, the CESM run has no year-to-year changes in the prescribed insolation, excluding any role of the solar cycle in the model&#8217;s 11-yr mode. The solar cycle is present, however, in the reanalysis, since it is present in nature and hence it does affect the observations. We speculate, therefore, that regional oscillations &#8212; with their distinct near-periodicities and spatial patterns &#8212; are synchronized&#160; over the globe, thus yielding both the global oscillatory modes found in CESM. In nature, the decadal mode could be further synchronized with the solar cycle, but that does not seem to be the case, given the slight difference in period &#8212; 12 yr for the reanalysis and 11 yr for the solar cycle, which makes them drift in and out of phase.</p><p>The work&#8217;s tentative conclusion is, therefore: (i) yes, there are global oscillatory modes in the climate system, especially a decadal mode; but (ii) no, this mode has little or nothing to do with the solar cycle.</p>"}, {"paperId": "01008f52947d1f028aeacc225d32ca8d6d159b67", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01008f52947d1f028aeacc225d32ca8d6d159b67", "title": "Robotic Platforms for Rapid Prototyping and Deployment of Sensor Systems in Support of Orbital Surveys", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144756941", "name": "A.

After the great success of WMESS 2015, with more than 500 participants from more than 50 countries, symposium became popular for scientists of different topics, classical and contemporary research related to Geosciences. This volume of Journal IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science contains 175 articles collected in four sections. The World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences symposium created a unique opportunity for participants to share research and work experience in the fields of Earth Sciences, providing a forum for early career researchers, for presentation of their work and discussion of their ideas with experts in different fields such as; Tectonics & Structural Geology - Engineering Geology - Geotechnics - Hydro-Hydrogeological Sciences - Natural Hazards - Oil, Gas & Coal, - Geothermal Energy - Geomorphology - Geochemistry, Mineralogy, Petrology & Volcanology - Stratigraphy, Sedimentology & Palaeontology - Geophysics & Seismology - Geodesy, Photogrammetry & Cartography - Informatics, Geoinformatics & Remote Sensing - Mining Engineering - Mineral Processing - Blasting & New Technologies - Natural Resources - Environmental Sciences - Energy, Resources & Pollution & the Environment - Environmental Legislation - Biogeosciences - Geological Heritage & Geoparks - Urban Planning - Atmospheric Sciences - Climatology - Glaciology - Modelling and Soft Computing Techniques in Earth Sciences. The main mission of the \"World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences Symposium - WMESS\" is to lead to contribution in multidisciplinary studies related with atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and pedosphere of the Earth and interaction of humans with them. As another mission, it provides a forum for this diverse range of studies which report the very latest results and document emerging understanding of the Earth's system and our place in it. This year, the Scientific Committee and Institutional Scientific Partners of WMESS were filled by paying close attention, and all members were selected from well-known, very much appreciated, productive and representative persons from different countries. We are deeply grateful to the members of the scientific committee and institutional scientific partners (International Association for Engineering Geology & the Environment - IAEG, International Union of Soil Sciences - IUSS, International Geographical Union - IGU, The International Association of Hydrogeologists - IAH, Geological Sciences of Italy - SGI, Czech Soil Science Society - CSSS, Arabian Geosciences Union - ArabGU, The Society of Economic Geology of Romania - SEGR, World Meteorological Organization - WMO, International Medical Geology Association - IMGA, Russian Mineralogical Society - RMS, University of Petrosani), Geological Society of Africa - GSAf of WMESS. We would also like to thank our main sponsors - LAMA Energy group, LAMA Gas & oil. The organizing committee appreciates enormous work of editorial board and reviewers in the preparation of this volume. This year volume was edited by Marian Drusa and co-editors Isik Yilmaz, Marian Marschalko, Anna Maria Ferrero, Ibolya Torok and Nazan Yalcin Erik. We would like to express our sincere thanks to all authors and presenters for their valuable research contributions. We wish you to enjoy the World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences Symposium \u2013 WMESS 2016 and a pleasant stay in the city of romance Prague.

Aim. To substantiate the reasonability and prove the effi ciency of using satellite data in the agroecologic monitoring system regarding the impact of climate changes on vegetation, processes of soil erosion degradation, and assessment of landscape diversity. Methods. The study was conducted in the territory of Ukraine. It involved the application of SWOT and Gap-analysis methodology, materials of NOAA satellite observa- tions, Sentinel, different spatial resolution, methodological and regulatory provision of the Institute of Agroecology and Environmental Economics of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences regarding satellite monitoring of the structure of agrolandscapes, norms of establishing a network of testing\nagrarian grounds, list of vegetation state indicators, in par- ticular, \u201cRemote sensing of the Earth from space. Land data about controlling the condition of plantings and performance of agricultural crops. General requirements: DSTU 7307:2013\u201d, \u201cRemote sensing of the Earth from space. Ground in- spection of plantings. Classifi er of objects and functions: SUC 01.1-37-907:2011\u201d, \u201cMethodological recommendations on establishing the network of testing agrarian grounds in the system of monitoring of plantings using the materials of cosmic information\u201d. The investigation on the impact of climate changes on vegetation state was conducted on the territory of three natural-climatic zones which were geographically represented by Chernihiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia regions re- spectively. The determination of the threat of erosion degradation of arable lands and landscape diversity was performed on the territory of two administrative districts with high level of ploughness of agrolandscapes, intense agrarian produc-\ntion and manifestation of erosion degradation of lands. Results. Inadequacy of the traditional system of agroecological monitoring was determined. It was proven that it was reasonable to have comprehensive application of satellite data regarding climate warming within the natural climatic zones and its impact on vegetation according to the normalized dif- ference vegetation index (NDVI), erosion degradation of soils and landscape diversity. According to satellite data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the correlation analysis was performed on the connection between the dynamics of the sum of effective temperatures and the sum of NDVI values for the vegetation period. There was positive impact of climate warming on vegetation state according to NDVI index in the zone of Polissia and Forest- Steppe. The correlation coeffi cients were R = 0.64 and R = 0.77 respectively. In the Steppe zone the correlation coeffi cient dropped down to R = 0.35 which demonstrated the elevated risk of\ndroughts. Conclusions. Satellite data of Sentinel-1 were used to determine critical zones of erosion degradation of arable lands, requiring preservation and their inclusion to the natural fi elds, which had a positive impact on the optimization of agrolandscape diversity."}, {"paperId": "0226c990a26a21516dad8eb11e4029d7cd9ebbb6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0226c990a26a21516dad8eb11e4029d7cd9ebbb6", "title": "Determining land use change and desertification in China using remote sensing data", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "103130844", "name": "L.

My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich. Penguin Random House, 2019. \nMy Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich is Ibi Zoboi\u2019s middle-grade debut, following her YA novels Pride and the National Book Award finalist American Street. Some of Zoboi\u2019s concerns in her YA fiction are revisited here: Black community and communities, complexities of family relationships, and the difficulties and joys of discovering new places. Here Zoboi adds to the mix a quirky, sci-fi loving protagonist, and a historical setting: Harlem in the summer of 1984. \nEbony-Grace Norfleet Freeman (aka E-Grace Starfleet in her galactic \"imagination location,\" aka Ice Cream Sandwich to the Nine Flavas crew of MCs and B-girls) is a seventh-grader from Huntsville who is sent to live with her father in New York City for the summer. She\u2019s full of science fiction knowledge and enthusiasm, abetted by her Granddaddy, who worked for NASA and occupies a large role in her internal narrative as Captain Fleet. \nEbony-Grace is a somewhat frustrating protagonist, making a number of seeming unforced errors due to her commitment to her spacefaring alter ego, but she is authentic and compelling, too. Her insistence on being E-Grace Starfleet can be endearing, though she\u2019s clearly using her imagination to avoid dealing with, or understanding, what\u2019s happening around her. She describes her surroundings in terms of her space adventure: that Captain Fleet has been taken captive by the Sonic King on Planet Boom Box, and that the Sonic Boom threatens to overtake everything. Her new friends initially have little time for this kind of play; they\u2019re busy developing their crew\u2019s double-dutch, rapping and breakdancing skills in preparation for a competition that might get them into the big leagues. The culture-shock contrast, in other words, isn\u2019t just between Huntsville and Harlem, but also between one kind of play and (although the Nine Flavas crew don\u2019t see it like this) another; between childhood and adolescence. \nA caution for readers who appreciate concreteness: one subplot seems ambiguous to the point of opacity. Ebony-Grace has been sent to New York because of some trouble her Granddaddy has gotten into, or possibly a health crisis he is having. There are allusions from adult characters to sins Ebony-Grace\u2019s grandfather has committed, consequences for bad decisions, lawyers, and journalists. His death near the end of the novel leaves both Ebony-Grace and the reader with questions but little closure; veiled references imply a sex-and-drugs aspect to his troubles, or a connection to the AIDS crisis, but this is never clarified.The narrative here is more atmospheric than propulsive, but that atmosphere is alive with culture and history. Character voices are lively, funny, and down to earth; their moment is depicted lovingly and specifically but without preciousness or nostalgia. This love letter to 1980s New York has mountains of appeal for any reader interested in science fiction or hip hop culture, and is a must for any collection looking to continue prioritizing diversity and representation in its holdings. \nHighly recommended: 4 out of 4 starsReviewer: Amanda Daignault\u00a0 \nAmanda Daignault is a PhD Candidate in the Department of English and Film Studies at the University of Alberta.

Especially since the 21st century, the number of major drought events in this region has significantly increased, making it a notable drought-prone area known as the northern drought-prone belt (NDPB). Till now, major drought events in this area have profoundly impacted China\u2019s historical progress and socioeconomic development. In fact, similar drought-prone belts are common in other monsoon transition zones globally, making it highly relevant and scientifically valuable to study the major drought issues in this region. Therefore, we discuss the major drought issues in the NDPB for the first time, comprehensively analyze the basic characteristics of the NDPB, systematically review the main stages of drought research in northern China, and identify scientific challenges currently faced in major drought research in the NDPB. Based on this and in line with the current forefront of earth system science research, we outline five research directions and their basic approaches, including scientific experimental research focusing on major droughts in the NDPB, the impact of multifactor atmospheric circulation interactions on major drought formation, mechanisms promoting major drought development through the land\u2013atmosphere coupling, the synergistic mechanisms of the atmospheric circulation and land\u2013atmosphere coupling on major droughts, and fine monitoring technology and prediction methods for the full-chain progression of major droughts that have multifactor collaborative impacts. This research work holds significant scientific reference value for promoting innovative breakthroughs in the theory of major drought formation and monitoring and prediction techniques in northern China."}, {"paperId": "02b89e9da6bf217bc2226fe71340685b1d080e25", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02b89e9da6bf217bc2226fe71340685b1d080e25", "title": "Getting a Fix on Fixation", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/307/5710/647.1.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

If, therefore, such influences exist on the sun, then wave formations must occur on it, and the sun spots, which have already been considered as vortex phenomena, as well as their variability, would thus find an explanation similar to that of the cyclones and anticyclones of the terrestrial atmosphere. I t thus becomes quite possible that the regular phenomena of the general atmospheric circulation of the earth may, for purely mechanical reasons, have the same period as those on the sun. In this case there would not need to exist any direct connection between the sun spots and our weather, even though the same period should be established beyond doubt by observation. On the other hand, a further development of the theory may, perhaps, lead to conclusions as to certain mechanical relations, especially as to the velocity of rotation of the sun. Even the discussion as to the influence of the moon on our weather, which is still by no means settled, will, in this way, be brought to an end, for it must then be possible to satisfactorily show whether the otherwise regular processes of atmospheric circulation are influenced by the changes in the moon's position, especially by its motion in declination. I t is to be hoped that the method here indicated may lead meteorology out of the region of vacillating ideas that now control it into a broader field, and place it among the exact sciences, where everything is reduced to numerical computation, and thus, to an important extent, further its application to daily practice."}, {"paperId": "02e5ae123f45eba3aff210a96f26792e21232c41", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02e5ae123f45eba3aff210a96f26792e21232c41", "title": "Exoplanet Science Priorities from the Perspective of Internal and Surface Processes for Silicate and Ice Dominated Worlds", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05094, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This reality in no way diminishes the central role of geophysical phenomena in shaping planetary outcomes, from formation, to thermal and chemical evolution, to numerous issues of surface and near-surface habitability. We emphasize that for a balanced understanding of extrasolar planets, it is important to look beyond the natural biases of current observing tools, and actively seek unique pathways to understand exoplanet interiors as best as possible during the long interim prior to a time when internal components are more directly accessible. Such pathways include but are not limited to: (a) enhanced theoretical and numerical modeling, (b) laboratory research on critical material properties, (c) measurement of geophysical properties by indirect inference from imprints left on atmospheric and orbital properties, and (d) the purpose-driven use of Solar System object exploration expressly for its value in comparative planetology toward exoplanet-analogs. Breaking down barriers that envision local Solar System exploration, including the study of Earth's own deep interior, as separate from and in financial competition with extrasolar planet research, may greatly improve the rate of needed scientific progress for exoplanet geophysics. As the number of known rocky and icy exoplanets grows in the years ahead, we expect demand for expertise in 'exogeoscience' will expand at a commensurately intense pace. We highlight key topics, including: how water oceans below ice shells may dominate the total habitability of our galaxy by volume, how free-floating nomad planets may often attain habitable subsurface oceans supported by radionuclide decay, and how deep interiors may critically interact with atmospheric mass loss via dynamo-driven magnetic fields."}, {"paperId": "02eb60f369aac3333b377e586a147ada0aa391a7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02eb60f369aac3333b377e586a147ada0aa391a7", "title": "Development of new analytical techniques for measuring radiosulfur in terrestrial samples to understand the present-day and Archean atmospheric sulfur cycles", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4818708", "name": "Mang Lin"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "0308ad82020f5d9ade39c3af3507ceb7a53930d9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0308ad82020f5d9ade39c3af3507ceb7a53930d9", "title": "Earth Science in the City: A Reader", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2003EO380013", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

[1] Mars 2020 will also demonstrate technologies needed to enable future human expeditions to Mars. Utilizing the groundbreaking entry, descent, and landing (EDL) architecture pioneered by the MSL, [2] [3] Mars 2020 will launch in July 2020 and land on Mars in February 2021. Like its predecessor, Mars 2020 will deliver its rover payload to the Martian surface through the use of Apollo-derived entry guidance, a 21.45 meter supersonic Disk-Gap-Band parachute, a Descent Stage powered by throttleable Mars lander engines, and the signature Sky Crane maneuver. While Mars 2020 inherits most of its EDL architecture, software, and hardware from the MSL, a number of changes have been made to correct deficiencies, improve performance, and increase the robustness of the system. For example, Mars 2020 will take advantage of the favorable atmospheric conditions of the 2020 launch opportunity to deliver a larger and more capable rover than has landed on Mars to date. A primary focus in developing the Mars 2020 EDL system has been mitigating residual risks identified after the landing of the MSL. The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiment (ASPIRE) was performed to address new concerns about the stresses experienced by parachute canopies during inflation. Other risk reduction activities include investigating possible interactions between the parachute deployment system and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) which could lead to IMU saturation, researching the effects of airborne dust on radar ground measurements, and site-specific gravity modeling for improved fuel usage. Several enhancements were added for Mars 2020 to improve performance. The addition of Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) allows the system to land at sites with more hazardous terrain, enabling scientists to select from locations which have previously been considered inaccessible. Mars 2020 will utilize a Range Trigger for initiating parachute deployment, which reduces landing ellipse sizes by 40% compared to the Velocity Trigger approach used on the MSL. New EDL Camera hardware will capture high resolution and high frame rate images and videos of key events, such as parachute deployment and rover touchdown. Finally, the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2) sensor suite will build upon the successful MSL MEDLI experiment with the addition of heatshield pressure sensors tuned for the supersonic flight regime and backshell instrumentation. The team has faced new and unexpected challenges throughout development. Notably, the failure of the flight heatshield during a static load test has prompted the fabrication of a new unit. Also, in accommodating the first ever Mars Helicopter under the rover belly pan, the EDL design has been further constrained by reduced ground clearances. Despite these challenges, much of the EDL-related hardware and software have already been delivered, and the EDL verification and validation program is on track to be completed on schedule prior to launch in July 2020."}, {"paperId": "0317884af46af820c1fd23e5e3a624cd6c970fdf", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0317884af46af820c1fd23e5e3a624cd6c970fdf", "title": "Petrologic, Elemental and Multi-Isotopic Characterization of Permafic Olivine-Phyric Shergottite Northwest Africa 5789: A Primitive Magma Derived from Depleted Martian Mantle", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145795540", "name": "A.

The metal exhibits useful properties such as low density, high strength, good formability and a high resistance to corrosion. Aluminium can gain significant mechanical strength by means of alloying, whereby it is the most used metal after steel. In this sense, aluminium properties depend on its purity and its crystalline structure is face centred cubic [Wang et al, 1999]. Aluminium is, among other characteristics, malleable, easily machined and very ductile. Its high sensitivity to oxidation endows it with a waterproof passivation layer, typically 5-20\u03bcm thick according to the prevailing humidity, considerably adherent, which contributes to corrosion tolerance and general durability. The passivation layer consists of the amphoteric aluminium oxide Al2O3, often known as alumina or aloxite in mining and materials science. As corrosion is a major source of failure in Materials Engineering, aluminium is an obvious choice to face aggressive environments, including the atmospheric one. Aluminium as a pure element has a low mechanical resistance which prevents its application under deformation and fracture conditions. Thus, low density combined with good resistance make aluminium alloys very attractive in design considerations. The properties of these alloys depend on a complex interaction among chemical composition, microstructural failures in solidification, thermal treatments, etc. although an increase in the alloy content tends, in general, to diminish the tolerance to corrosion. That is why quenching processes have been developed to improve the response to corrosion of highly alloyed materials. It is essential to select the precise alloy to match the resistance, ductibility, formability, solubility, corrosion tolerance, etc., required by an application. Modifying aluminium composition by the adding nitrogen in an ion implantation process provides the treated samples with surface hardness and improved tribological properties by heating them in a nitrogen rich atmosphere. In this way, at low doses, aluminium nitride (AlN) becomes structured in the shape of clusters, the nitride content clearly increasing with the dose. Ion implantation is applied to pieces subjected to major friction and load forces such as rolling tracks, cylinder sleeves, etc., which require some core plasticity enabling"}, {"paperId": "032eb258cebda60432ba5f94ea49feed9e9133a5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/032eb258cebda60432ba5f94ea49feed9e9133a5", "title": "When the Sun Went Strangely Quiet", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Furthermore, as we address the expanding reproducibility crisis in the sciences, we must work to release research materials in ways that enable reproducibility-publishing data, computer code, and research products in addition to the traditional journal article. Toward addressing these needs, we present an example framework to model and map soil organic carbon (SOC) in the cereal grains production region of the northwestern United States. Primarily associated with soil organic matter, SOC relates to many soil properties that influence resiliency and soil health for agriculture. It is also critical for understanding soil-atmospheric C flux, a significant part of the overall C budget of the Earth. The technique for modeling soil properties uses seven categories of environmental input data to make predictions: known soil attributes, climatic values, organisms present, relief, parent material, age, and spatial location. We gather data representing these categories from various public sources. The map is produced using a random forest statistical model with inputs to predict SOC content on a 30-m spatial grid. All modeling components including input data, metadata, computer code, and output products are made freely available under an explicit open-source license. In this way, reproducibility is supported, the methods and code released are available to be reused by other researchers, and the research products are open to critical review and improvement."}, {"paperId": "03693a87686c9a4984b6812a28028fa7eaa35651", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03693a87686c9a4984b6812a28028fa7eaa35651", "title": "Elastic wave propagation and scattering in anisotropic fractured media", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "26589652", "name": "R.

GWs can propagate horizontally and vertically and are important for atmospheric dynamics, influencing the atmospheric thermal and dynamical structure. Research on GWs is connected with some of the most challenging issues of Earth climate and atmospheric science. Consideration of GW-related processes is necessary for a proper description and modelling of the middle and upper atmosphere. However, as GWs exist on scales from a few to thousands of kilometers, they cannot be fully resolved by general circulation models (GCMs) and hence have to be parameterized. Although recently satellite and reanalysis datasets with improved resolution and novel analysis methods together with high-resolution atmospheric models have been tightening the constraints for GW parameterizations in GCMs, the parameterized GW effects still bear a significant margin of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>To quantify this uncertainty, we analyze the three-dimensional distribution and interannual variability of orographic gravity wave drag (OGWD) in chemistry-climate model simulations. For this, we use a set of AMIP simulations produced within the CMIP6 activity. In particular, we focus on the intermodel spread in the vertical and horizontal OGWD distribution. The different models generaly agree on the areas of the OGWD hotspots. However, in all these regions we find considerable intermodel differences in OGWD magnitude as well as in the altitude of the strongest GW dissipation. In this presentation, we show our findings and discuss possible explanations for the intermodel differences, like different parametrization schemes and choices of tunable parameters.</p>"}, {"paperId": "03839d871ab07da7910b478aa11cd8b24defc668", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03839d871ab07da7910b478aa11cd8b24defc668", "title": "Application for Hospital Screening of Suspected Patients with Zika, Dengue, or Chikungunya", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

One of the most relevant science cases is represented by the detection of life signature in the extrasolar atmospheres for Earth-like planets. The polarimetric unit, feeding the UBVRI and the zYJH spectrograph modules, will consist of two subassemblies: the main one, aimed to be installed in the intermediate focus, will host the polarizer (a double Wollaston calcite prism) and the retarder plates splitting the optical beam into the four Stokes vector components; the other will be located in one of the four dedicated arms of the Front End on the Nasmyth platform, providing the atmospheric dispersion correction, field stabilization and selection of the operating modes before the fiber injection. At the conclusion of Phase A, we have presented this as the optimal design solution fulfilling the top level requirement of reaching a sensitivity of 10-5 S/I (S being equivalent to one of the Stokes vectors), a condition achievable only if the polarizers are installed in a rotationally symmetric focus. The current work, which can be considered a continuation of two preceding papers, illustrates new simulation results from the development of the polarization-ray-tracing tool. We have included also the crystal anisotropic properties of the polarizing components, analyzing the transmission loss that the light beam encounters propagating through the optical train before entering the fiber bundles in the different operating modes, bearing in mind the polarimetric aberrations induced by the active compensation of the primary mirror and the loads contributing as Zernike polynomials of different orders, namely the telescope cross-talk."}, {"paperId": "03a0248e0956cccea8534190977ec46055281b46", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03a0248e0956cccea8534190977ec46055281b46", "title": "Small scale disturbances in the lower dayside ionosphere of Mars as seen by the MaRS radio science experiment on Mars Express", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47811945", "name": "K.

Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-cover change data and bookkeeping models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \u00b11\u03c3. For the last decade available (2007\u20132016), EFF was 9.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, ELUC 1.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, GATM 4.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, SOCEAN 2.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, and SLAND 3.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.6\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For year 2016 alone, the growth in EFF was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121. Also for 2016, ELUC was 1.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, GATM was 6.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, SOCEAN was 2.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, and SLAND was 2.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, with a small BIM of \u22120.3\u202fGtC. GATM continued to be higher in 2016 compared to the past decade (2007\u20132016), reflecting in part the high fossil emissions and the small SLAND consistent with El Nino conditions. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 402.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fppm averaged over 2016. For 2017, preliminary data for the first 6\u20139 months indicate a renewed growth in EFF of +2.0\u202f% (range of 0.8 to 3.0\u202f%) based on national emissions projections for China, USA, and India, and projections of gross domestic product (GDP) corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quere et al., 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

In the context of earth system sciences, particularly atmospheric science, LES are uniquely able to resolve the scales of atmospheric motion that are key for building process-level understanding of boundary layer turbulence, atmosphere-surface interaction, clouds, and cloud-aerosol-chemistry interaction, and are a core limited-area modeling capability. Increasing demands are being placed on LES code bases as growing high performance computing resources allow LES to address a wider range of scientific problems. In addition, LES are emerging as a source of high-quality machine learning training data. These demands necessitate an agile and extensible code base that allows the model to quickly adapt to emergent needs. However, LES have largely relied on legacy Fortran code bases that lack flexibility. A new, Python-based LES capability called Predicting INteractions of Aerosol and Clouds in Large Eddy Simulation (PINACLES) has been developed as part of the Department of Energy\u2019s Earth System Model Development (ESMD) program area\u2019s Enabling Aerosol-cloud interactions at Global convection-permitting scalES (EAGLES) project. PINACLES was developed from the ground up with a philosophy of maximizing scientific throughput, by attempting to optimize for both model throughput and software extensibility. The initial development of PINACLES delivered a state-of-the-art idealized LES capability solving the non-hydrostatic anelastic equations of motion with doubly periodic boundary conditions and idealized homogenous surface boundary conditions. Here we provide a final report on the outcomes of a fiscal year 2021 Seed Laboratory Directed Research Project that extended PINACLES in two key ways. First, PINACLES was coupled to a state-of-the-art land surface model enabling it to simulate spatially inhomogeneous land-atmosphere interactions that are known to control key atmospheric processes. Second, the dynamical core of PINACLES was modified to permit non-periodic boundary conditions. This model enhancement enables simulation of realistic cases with boundary conditions prescribed from atmospheric reanalysis and enables nested simulations conducted on a hierarchy of computational domains with increasing resolution. Together, these extensions to PINACLES make it a formidable modeling capability and expand its potential application to diverse components of DOE\u2019s"}, {"paperId": "03d5d880edb785a28732992e1ae4a49062aa96a1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03d5d880edb785a28732992e1ae4a49062aa96a1", "title": "Editorial: mass spectrometric approaches for chemical characterisation of atmospheric aerosols", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/pdf/ENv9n3_ED", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The family of cones of varying apex angle permits the systematic study across shapes from slender or sharp to broad or dull, and we find that only specific forms achieve the stably oriented flight needed to explain this class of meteorites. More generally, our study provides the map relating body shape to free fall motions, such as gliding, tumbling, straight descent, and fluttering, which will prove useful in aeronautics, the atmospheric sciences, and chemical engineering. The atmospheric ablation of meteoroids is a striking example of the reshaping of a solid object due to its motion through a fluid. Motivated by meteorite samples collected on Earth that suggest fixed orientation during flight\u2014most notably the conical shape of so-called oriented meteorites\u2014we hypothesize that such forms result from an aerodynamic stabilization of posture that may be achieved only by specific shapes. Here, we investigate this issue of flight stability in the parallel context of fluid mechanical erosion of clay bodies in flowing water, which yields shapes resembling oriented meteorites. We conduct laboratory experiments on conical objects freely moving through water and fixed within imposed flows to determine the dependence of orientational stability on shape. During free motion, slender cones undergo postural instabilities, such as inversion and tumbling, and broad or dull forms exhibit oscillatory modes, such as rocking and fluttering. Only intermediate shapes, including the stereotypical form carved by erosion, achieve stable orientation and straight flight with apex leading. We corroborate these findings with systematic measurements of torque and stability potentials across cones of varying apex angle, which furnish a complete map of equilibrium postures and their stability. By showing that the particular conical form carved in unidirectional flows is also posturally stable as a free body in flight, these results suggest a self-consistent picture for the origin of oriented meteorites."}, {"paperId": "03e3e0596bcf1d19852ef14fbf476b10b6823534", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03e3e0596bcf1d19852ef14fbf476b10b6823534", "title": "Forthcoming Books of Science", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/095050a0.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

There is a strong correlation between economic development and energy consumption. Energy security plays an important role in all economic sectors in attaining the long-term vision of inclusive economic growth and development of the economy. The attainment of this vision is difficult as it is challenged by the need to build energy infrastructures that are not only responsive to the growing demand but can withstand the maximum credible natural disaster. One of the primary objectives of sustainable development is to make people without access to enough energy be able to meet their needs through the provision of stable, reliable, clean, safe, and affordable energy services. This research will use the Granger Causality test to analyze the causal relationship among the endogenous variables among (1) GNI per capita; (2) GHG Emissions; and (3) Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) between energy-economic development and the influencing factors of power supply security indicators. In the end, this paper expects to suggest that the paper electric power development plans in the country also have implications for the path that would lead the country to what is known as a green economy. It is in this background that energy security and economic growth development are intertwined by public policy. In a broader development sense, public policy draws in the active involvement of the community in identifying problems. Anchored deeply in the national development agenda, the local community develops its own sets of development goals and pushes itself towards realizing this long-range vision. Hence, the output of public policy supported by strategic planning will require effective monitoring and evaluation of programs. This remains to be both a challenge and priority for both the national and local governments.ReferencesAstana, K. (2011).

As such, ARIEL has been the subject of a Phase A study that involved European industry, research institutes and universities from ESA member states. This study is now completed and the M4 down-selection is expected to be concluded in November 2017. ARIEL is a concept for a dedicated mission to measure the chemical composition and structure of hundreds of exoplanet atmospheres using the technique of transit spectroscopy. ARIEL targets extend from gas giants (Jupiter or Neptune-like) to super-Earths in the very hot to warm zones of F to M-type host stars, opening up the way to large-scale, comparative planetology that would place our own Solar System in the context of other planetary systems in the Milky Way. A technical and programmatic review of the ARIEL mission was performed between February and May 2017, with the objective of assessing the readiness of the mission to progress to the Phase B1 study. No critical issues were identified and the mission was deemed technically feasible within the M4 programmatic boundary conditions. In this paper we give an overview of the final mission concept for ARIEL as of the end of the Phase A study, from scientific, technical and operational perspectives."}, {"paperId": "0424041f51b76a9a2a925d2b52df90a118e54039", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0424041f51b76a9a2a925d2b52df90a118e54039", "title": "Dimensional Analysis, Scale Analysis, and Similarity Theories", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50116761", "name": "David A.

The International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric\nSciences (IAMAS) was founded in 1919 as the Section of Meteorology\nof the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG).\nSignificant advances over human history, particularly during the 19th\ncentury, in the gathering, communication, assembly and analysis of\nobservations of the changing weather and in theoretical understanding of the\nfundamental physical relationships and processes governing atmospheric\ncirculation had been driven by the need for improved weather and climate\nforecasts to support the expansion of global trade, better public warnings of\nextreme weather, and safer and more effective military operations. Since its\nfoundation, in parallel and cooperation with intergovernmental development\nunder the auspices of what is now the World Meteorological\nOrganization (WMO), IAMAS and its 10 international commissions have\nprovided the international organizational framework for the convening of the\ngeneral and scientific assemblies and other meetings that bring together\nexpert scientists from around the world to further advance scientific\nunderstanding and prediction of the behaviour of the atmosphere and its\nconnections to and effects on other components of the Earth's intercoupled\ngeophysical system.\n"}, {"paperId": "04a2dbc75821dd7a2a174e8763e6f63451a3856f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04a2dbc75821dd7a2a174e8763e6f63451a3856f", "title": "Summary of Potassium/Argon Dating - 1982", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/894095", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In addition, the PE method is used to analyze the field distribution of electromagnetic wave propagation in the waveguide, the simulation results show that the PE analysis has a good effect on the high frequency electromagnetic wave over GHz, and the multipath propagation in waveguide has great advantage in long distance communication. The research in this paper gets the constructive and innovative achievements in the establishment of the multipath model, the loss performance and the visual analysis and other aspects."}, {"paperId": "04a5805ecd11c022c3bc102b96253dfa6e542da6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04a5805ecd11c022c3bc102b96253dfa6e542da6", "title": "Vegetation phenology from multi-temporal EOS MODIS data", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Many of the sites are located in regions influenced by specific aerosol types (Asian and Saharan desert dust, Asian pollution, biomass burning, etc.). This network of monitoring stations is a shared endeavor of NOAA and many collaborating organizations, including the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\u2019s Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), several U.S. and foreign universities, and foreign science organizations. The result is a long-term cooperative program making atmospheric measurements that are directly comparable with those from all the other network stations and with shared data access. The protocols and software developed to support the program facilitate participation in GAW\u2019s atmospheric observation strategy, and the sites in the NOAA/ESRL network make up a substantial subset of the GAW aerosol observations. This paper describes the history of the NOAA/ESRL Federated Aerosol Network, details about measurements and operations, and some recent findings from the network measurements."}, {"paperId": "04ed728df30b6f4b5b9ecf26585eafb79078eab8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04ed728df30b6f4b5b9ecf26585eafb79078eab8", "title": "Suborbital Science Program: Dryden Flight Research Center", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "95711400", "name": "J.

Atmospheric aerosol particles (also referred to as particulate matter, PM) play a key role in defining the air that the future generations will breathe but also the climates they live in, PM being an important short-lived climate forcer but also a key component of air quality and global environmental health hazard. The contribution of aerosol particles has been a key uncertainty in estimates of the Earth&#8217;s radiative forcing since the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and still remains as the single largest quoted source of uncertainty in the anthropogenic climate forcing during the industrial period. In the latest assessment by the IPCC, the radiative forcing by aerosol particles has been estimated to be -0.45 W m-2 (between -0.95 and 0.05 W m-2) for aerosol-radiation interactions (RFari) and -0.45 W m-2 (between -1.25 and 0 W m-2) for aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci). Recent reviews indicate no significant reduction in the uncertainty. The large range of possible aerosol forcing values has serious consequences for climate projections and therefore developing strategies for reaching Paris agreement targets. It is currently not possible to say if a reduction in aerosol emissions due to air pollution mitigation and a phase-out of aerosol emissions will result in a noticeable increase in global mean temperature&#160; or in a negligible climate effect. We will discuss the components and reasons of this uncertainty, focusing on those that are important for aerosol-cloud interactions. We will identify critical bottlenecks in 1) scientific understanding of fundamental aerosol and cloud microphysical processes; 2) method development for improving the understanding of aerosol, cloud, and aerosol-cloud processes as well as their representation in Earth System Models (ESMs); and 3) knowledge transfer within and between the relevant research communities. We will argue for key actions to overcome these bottlenecks, giving examples of good practices for breaking new ground in this long-standing problem that continues to intrigue the atmospheric and climate science communities. Besides enhancing the scientific understanding of the Earth system within the realm of natural science based on multiple lines of evidence, and developing novel (e.g. machine learning &#8211;based) methodologies for analyzing existing observational data and model output, we call for additional perspectives from social science and humanities on the communication and knowledge transfer practices within atmospheric and climate research. Making the relevant knowledge transfer pathways and processes transparent is urgently needed to enable systematic determination of the actions required to maximally utilize the existing knowledge, and to ensure effective implementation of new results that may help to narrow down the uncertainty associated with aerosols in climate projections. Improved understanding of the role of aerosols in the climate system will result in enhanced credibility of ESMs and hence also tighter constraints for policies aiming for simultaneous climate neutrality and zero pollution targets.</p>"}, {"paperId": "05325267dca0cf28c6b519924a6a1abecab50936", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05325267dca0cf28c6b519924a6a1abecab50936", "title": "Changes of land cover and land use and greenhouse gas emissions in northern Eurasia (Abstract)", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144154192", "name": "Q.

We use aircraft observations obtained during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) mission to examine the distributions and source attributions of O 3 and NO y in the Arctic and sub-Arctic region. Using a number of marker tracers, we distinguish various air masses from the back- ground troposphere and examine their contributions to NO x , O 3 , and O 3 production in the Arctic troposphere. The back- ground Arctic troposphere has a mean O 3 of \u223c60 ppbv and NO x of \u223c25 pptv throughout spring and summer with CO decreasing from \u223c145 ppbv in spring to \u223c100 ppbv in sum- mer. These observed mixing ratios are not notably different from the values measured during the 1988 ABLE-3A and the 2002 TOPSE field campaigns despite the significant changes in emissions and stratospheric ozone layer in the past two decades that influence Arctic tropospheric composition. Air masses associated with stratosphere-troposphere exchange are present throughout the mid and upper troposphere during spring and summer. These air masses, with mean O 3 con- centrations of 140\u2013160 ppbv, are significant direct sources of O 3 in the Arctic troposphere. In addition, air of stratospheric origin displays net O 3 formation in the Arctic due to its sus- tainable, high NO x (75 pptv in spring and 110 pptv in sum- mer) and NO y (\u223c800 pptv in spring and \u223c1100 pptv in sum- mer). The air masses influenced by the stratosphere sam- pled during ARCTAS-B also show conversion of HNO 3 to PAN. This active production of PAN is the result of increased degradation of ethane in the stratosphere-troposphere mixed air mass to form CH 3 CHO, followed by subsequent forma- tion of PAN under high NO x conditions. These findings imply that an adequate representation of stratospheric NO y input, in addition to stratospheric O 3 influx, is essential to accurately simulate tropospheric Arctic O 3 , NO x and PAN in chemistry transport models. Plumes influenced by recent anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions observed dur- ing ARCTAS show highly elevated levels of hydrocarbons and NO y (mostly in the form of NO x and PAN), but do not contain O 3 higher than that in the Arctic tropospheric back- ground except some aged biomass burning plumes sampled during spring. Convection and/or lightning influences are negligible sources of O 3 in the Arctic troposphere but can have significant impacts in the upper troposphere in the con- tinental sub-Arctic during summer.

The GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (CTM), used by a large atmospheric chemistry research community, has been re-engineered to also serve as an atmospheric chemistry module for Earth system models (ESMs). This was done using an Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) interface that operates independently of the GEOS-Chem scientific code, permitting the exact same GEOS-Chem code to be used as an ESM module or as a stand-alone CTM. In this manner, the continual stream of updates contributed by the CTM user community is automatically passed on to the ESM module, which remains state of science and referenced to the latest version of the standard GEOS-Chem CTM. A major step in this re-engineering was to make GEOS-Chem grid independent, i.e., capable of using any geophysical grid specified at run time. GEOS-Chem data sockets were also created for communication between modules and with external ESM code. The grid-independent, ESMF-compatible GEOS-Chem is now the standard version of the GEOS-Chem CTM. It has been implemented as an atmospheric chemistry module into the NASA GEOS-5 ESM. The coupled GEOS-5\u2013GEOS-Chem system was tested for scalability and performance with a tropospheric oxidant-aerosol simulation (120 coupled species, 66 transported tracers) using 48\u2013240 cores and message-passing interface (MPI) distributed-memory parallelization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the GEOS-Chem chemistry module scales efficiently for the number of cores tested, with no degradation as the number of cores increases. Although inclusion of atmospheric chemistry in ESMs is computationally expensive, the excellent scalability of the chemistry module means that the relative cost goes down with increasing number of cores in a massively parallel environment."}, {"paperId": "05b34744af83c0da609b15421358f326f5170290", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05b34744af83c0da609b15421358f326f5170290", "title": "The Cryosphere and ATmospheric CHemistry (CATCH): Research challenges and opportunities for collaboration", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "92968540", "name": "Daiki Nomura"}, {"authorId": "2115544010", "name": "Jennie L.

Prasad"}], "abstract": "For a drought-prone agricultural nation such as Australia, hydro-meteorological imbalances and increasing demand for water resources are immensely constraining terrestrial water reservoirs and regional-scale agricultural productivity. Two important components of the terrestrial water reservoir i.e., streamflow water level (SWL) and soil moisture (SM), are imperative both for agricultural and hydrological applications. Forecasted SWL and SM can enable prudent and sustainable decisionmaking for agriculture and water resources management. To feasibly emulate SWL and SM, machine learning data-intelligent models are a promising tool in today\u2019s rapidly advancing data science era. Yet, the naturally chaotic characteristics of hydro-meteorological variables that can exhibit non-linearity and non-stationarity behaviors within the model dataset, is a key challenge for non-tuned machine learning models. Another important issue that could confound model accuracy or applicability is the selection of relevant features to emulate SWL and SM since the use of too fewer inputs can lead to insufficient information to construct an accurate model while the use of an excessive number and redundant model inputs could obscure the performance of the simulation algorithm. \n \nThis research thesis focusses on the development of hybridized dataintelligent models in forecasting SWL and SM in the upper layer (surface to 0.2 m) and the lower layer (0.2\u20131.5 m depth) within the agricultural region of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The SWL quantifies the availability of surface water resources, while, the upper layer SM (or the surface SM) is important for surface runoff, evaporation, and energy exchange at the Earth-Atmospheric interface. The lower layer (or the root zone) SM is essential for groundwater recharge purposes, plant uptake and transpiration. This research study is constructed upon four primary objectives designed for the forecasting of SWL and SM with subsequent robust evaluations by means of statistical metrics, in tandem with the diagnostic plots of observed and modeled datasets. \n \nThe first objective establishes the importance of feature selection (or optimization) in the forecasting of monthly SWL at three study sites within the Murray-Darling Basin. Artificial neural network (ANN) model optimized with iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm named IIS-ANN is developed whereby the IIS algorithm achieves feature optimization. The IIS-ANN model outperforms the standalone models and a further hybridization is performed by integrating a nondecimated and advanced maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) technique. The IIS selected inputs are transformed into wavelet subseries via MODWT to unveil the embedded features leading to IIS-W-ANN model. The IIS-W-ANN outperforms the comparative IIS-W-M5 Model Tree, IIS-based and standalone models. \n \nIn the second objective, improved self-adaptive multi-resolution analysis (MRA) techniques, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) are utilized to address the non-stationarity issues in forecasting monthly upper and lower layer soil moisture at seven sites. The SM time-series are decomposed using EEMD/CEEMDAN into respective intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residual components. Then the partial-auto correlation function based significant lags are \nutilized as inputs to the extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF) models. The hybrid EEMD-ELM yielded better results in comparison to the CEEMDAN-ELM, EEMD-RF, CEEMDAN-RF and the classical ELM and RF models. \n \nSince SM is contingent upon many influential meteorological, hydrological and atmospheric parameters, for the third objective sixty predictor inputs are collated \nin forecasting upper and lower layer soil moisture at four sites. An ANN-based ensemble committee of models (ANN-CoM) is developed integrating a two-phase feature optimization via Neighborhood Component Analysis based feature selection algorithm for regression (fsrnca) and a basic ELM. The ANN-CoM shows better predictive performance in comparison to the standalone second order Volterra, M5 Model Tree, RF, and ELM models. \n \nIn the fourth objective, a new multivariate sequential EEMD based modelling is developed. The establishment of multivariate sequential EEMD is an advancement \nof the classical single input EEMD approach, achieving a further methodological improvement. This multivariate approach is developed to allow for the utilization of \nmultiple inputs in forecasting SM. The multivariate sequential EEMD optimized with cross-correlation function and Boruta feature selection algorithm is integrated with the ELM model in emulating weekly SM at four sites. The resulting hybrid multivariate sequential EEMD-Boruta-ELM attained a better performance in comparison with the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) counterpart (EEMD-Boruta-MARS) and standalone ELM and MARS models. \n \nThe research study ascertains the applicability of feature selection algorithms integrated with appropriate MRA for improved hydrological forecasting. Forecasting at shorter and near-real-time horizons (i.e., weekly) would help reinforce scientific tenets in designing knowledge-based systems for precision agriculture and climate change adaptation policy formulations."}, {"paperId": "05e9b0b977715c3dd7fd984b1d6a66f9fb29cea9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05e9b0b977715c3dd7fd984b1d6a66f9fb29cea9", "title": "Preface to the special section \u201cSoil and plant aspects in the Integrated Land Ecosystem\u2013Atmosphere Processes Study (iLEAPS)\u201d", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00380768.2015.995754?needAccess=true", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Satellite observations and model reanalysis data play an important role in filling these gaps. Established in the mid-1980s, the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), as one of the 12 NASA data centers, archives and distributes data from several Earth science disciplines such as precipitation, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric composition, and hydrology, including well-known NASA satellite missions (e.g., TRMM, GPM) and model assimilation projects (MERRA-2). Acquiring datasets suitable for tropical cyclone research in a large data archive is a challenge for many, especially for those who are not familiar with satellite or model data. Over the years, the GES DISC has developed user-friendly data services. For example, Giovanni is an online visualization and analysis tool, allowing users to visualize and analyze over 2000 satellite- and model-based variables with a Web browser, without downloading data and software. In this chapter, we will describe data and services at the GES DISC with emphasis on tropical cyclone research.

Moisture transport to this region is important for climate projections because it drives the formation of local cirrus (ice) clouds, which have a disproportionate impact on the Earth's radiative balance. Deep cumulus towers carrying large volumes of ice are known to reach the TTL, but their importance to the water budget has been debated for several decades. We show here that profiles of the isotopic composition of water vapor can provide a quantitative estimate of the convective contribution to TTL moistening. Isotopic measurements from the ACE satellite instrument, in conjunction with ice loads inferred from CALIOP satellite measurements and simple mass-balance modeling, suggest that convection is the dominant source of water vapor in the TTL up to near-tropopause altitudes. The relatively large ice loads inferred from CALIOP satellite measurements can be produced only with significant water sources, and isotopic profiles imply that these sources are predominantly convective ice. Sublimating ice from deep convection appears to increase TTL cirrus by a factor of several over that expected if cirrus production were driven only by large-scale uplift; sensitivity analysis implies that these conclusions are robust for most physically reasonable assumptions. Changes in tropical deep convection in future warmer conditions may thus provide an important climate feedback."}, {"paperId": "06a88436e09029cd6acd1f5aa1e69bdfe4a68629", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06a88436e09029cd6acd1f5aa1e69bdfe4a68629", "title": "HIGH-PRESSURE CHEMISTRY Alkali element mimics transition metal", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The tidal heating Io undergoes through its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede has resulted in a body rich in active silicate volcanism. Over the past decades, Io has been observed from ground-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes and by several spacecraft. In this review we summarize the progress made toward our understanding of the physical and chemical processes related to Io and its environment since the Galileo era. Io science has been revolutionized by the use of adaptive optics techniques on large, 8- to 10-m telescopes. The resultant ever-increasing database, mapping the size, style, and spatial distribution of Io's diverse volcanoes, has improved our understanding of Io's interior structure, its likely composition, and the tidal heating process. Additionally, new observations of Io's atmosphere obtained with these large optical/infrared telescopes and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array reveal the presence of volcanic plumes, the (at times) near-collapse of Io's atmosphere during eclipse, and the interactions of plumes with the sublimation atmosphere. \u25aa Extensive new data sets of Io at ultraviolet, mid- to near-infrared, and radio wavelengths have been gathered since the Galileo era. \u25aa New data and models inform us about tidal heating, surface properties, and magma composition across Io\u2014although key questions remain. \u25aa Atmospheric observations indicate a dominant sublimation-supported component and reinforce the presence of stealth volcanism. \u25aa Observations of volcanic plumes show high gas velocities (up to \u223c1 km/s) and their effect on Io's atmosphere.

In the context of prevailing narratives of late planetary capitalism and the Anthropocene, \u2018we\u2019 \u2013 the Western anti-heroes of planetary destruction \u2013 have a problem with time.

This study is the first to be validated by ground-based and satellite data in the plasmasphere and both hemispheres. The main finding is that the entire ionosphere-plasmasphere system is very sensitive to the neutral hydrogen density in the lower exosphere. It was found that an increase in the H density by a factor of 2.75 from the commonly accepted values was necessary to bring the simulated plasma density into satisfactory agreement with Arase satellite measurements in the plasmasphere and also with DMSP satellite measurements in the topside ionospheres of the northern and southern hemispheres. A factor of 2.75 increase in the H density increases the simulated plasma density in the afternoon plasmasphere up to \u223c80% and in the nighttime topside ionosphere up to \u223c100%. These results indicate prominently that using the commonly accepted empirical model of the H density causes unacceptable errors in the simulated plasma density of the near-Earth plasma shells. We alert the space science community of this problem."}, {"paperId": "06c410a796f913fe13c117d18b42c3cf218488e4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06c410a796f913fe13c117d18b42c3cf218488e4", "title": "Land use change detection in Denizli City Center using spectral angle mapper method and evaluations in terms of some earth science data Spektral ac\u0327\u0131 haritalama yo\u0308ntemi ile Denizli Kent Merkezi arazi kullan\u0131m deg\u0306is\u0327im tespiti ve baz\u0131 yerbilim verileri ac\u0327\u0131s\u0131ndan deg\u0306erlendirilmesi", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40556852", "name": "Tolga \u00c7an"}, {"authorId": "2066601072", "name": "S.

The Venus Airglow Measurements and Orbiter for Seismicity (VAMOS) mission concept uses the fact that the dense Venusian atmosphere conducts seismic vibrations from the surface to the airglow layer of the ionosphere, as observed on Earth. Similarly, atmospheric gravity waves have been observed by the European Venus Express\u2019s Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) instrument. Such observations would enable VAMOS to determine the crustal structure and ionospheric variability of Venus without approaching the surface or atmosphere. Equipped with an instrument of modest size and mass, the baseline VAMOS spacecraft is designed to fit within an ESPA Grande form factor and travel to Venus predominantly under its own power. Trade studies have been conducted to determine mission architecture robustness to launch and rideshare opportunities. The VAMOS mission concept was studied at JPL as part of the NASA Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program, which has not only produced a viable and exciting mission concept for a Venus SmallSat, but has also examined many issues facing the development of SmallSats for planetary exploration, such as SmallSat solar electric propulsion, autonomy, telecommunications, and resource management that can be applied to various inner solar system mission architectures."}, {"paperId": "06d8e2f32ab206a8cdaa55d133d8b82dcc7bcb53", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06d8e2f32ab206a8cdaa55d133d8b82dcc7bcb53", "title": "The History of Cardiac Surgery 1896-1955", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2591718, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In the words of the organizer of this symposium, Mr. S. Fred Singer, the purposes \"were to discuss the worldwide effects which may arise from local pollution and to try to uncover, if possible, hitherto unsuspected effects which might have serious consequence.\" The symposium papers have been augmented here by some additional invited papers and by introductions to each set of papers. The book is not as comprehensive as the title suggests; many aspects of environmental pollution are not discussed, e.g., thermal pollution of air and water from the conversion of energy by the combustion of fossil fuels. Information about environmental pollution is divided into four parts: 1) chemical balance of gases in the earth's atmosphere 2) nitrogen compounds in soil, water, atmosphere and precipitation 3) effects of atmospheric pollution on climate and 4) worldwide ocean pollution by toxic wastes. It is apparent from this classification that the primary focus of these papers is the atmospheric sciences. The discussions of the balance of oxygen and of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere are particularly well done. This book should interest all students of human ecology as it provides much factual material about some of the present problems of environmental pollution. Although much of the material presented is very technical, the papers are easy to read and to understand, but those who are looking for proposed solutions to current pollution problems may be disappointed in the book because such proposals are lacking. This is a book that should find its way into the library of all scientists. It is well written and the brief concluding chapter entitled \"Some Unsolved Problems: A Panel Discussion\" is particularly provocative. ERIC W.

This large aperture and collecting area can help extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems such as GMT\u2019s GMagAO-X achieve the small angular resolutions and contrasts required to image habitable zone earth-like planets around late type stars and possibly lead to the discovery of life outside of our solar system. However, the GMT primary mirror segments are separated by large > 30 cm gaps, creating the possibility of fluctuations in optical path differences (piston) due to flexure, segment vibrations, wind buffeting, temperature effects, and atmospheric seeing. In order to utilize the full diffraction-limited aperture of the GMT for high-contrast natural guide star adaptive optics (NGSAO) science, the seven mirror segments must be co-phased to well within a fraction of a wavelength. The current design of the GMT involves seven adaptive secondary mirrors, a slow (\u223c 0.03 Hz) off-axis dispersed fringe sensor (part of the Acquisition Guiding and Wavefront Sensing System\u2019s [AGWS] active optics off-axis guider), and a pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS; part of the Natural Guide star Wavefront Sensor [NGWS] adaptive optics) to measure and correct the total path length between segment pairs, but these methods have yet to be tested \u201cend-to-end\u201d in a lab environment. We present the design and working prototype of a \u201cGMT High Contrast adaptive Optics phasing Testbed\u201d (p-HCAT) which leverages the existing MagAO-X ExAO instrument to demonstrate segment phase sensing and simultaneous AO-control for high-contrast GMT natural guide star science (i.e., testing the NGWS wavefront sensor [WFS] architecture). We present the first test results of closed-loop piston control with one GMT segment using MagAO-X\u2019s PyWFS with and without simulated atmospheric turbulence. We show that the PyWFS was able to successfully control segment piston without turbulence within 12-33 nm RMS for 0 \u03bb/D \u2013 5 \u03bb/D modulation, but was unsuccessful at controlling segment piston with generated \u223c 0.6 arcsec (median seeing conditions at the GMT site) and\u223c 1.2 arcsec seeing turbulence due to non-linear modal cross-talk and poor pixel sampling of the segment gaps on the PyWFS detector. These results suggest that a PyWFS alone is not an ideal piston sensor for the GMT (and likely the TMT and ELT). Hence, a dedicated \u201csecond channel\u201d piston sensor is required. We report the success of an alternate solution to control piston using a novel Holographic Dispersed Fringe Sensor (HDFS) while controlling all other modes with the PyWFS purely as a slope sensor (piston mode removed). This \u201csecond channel\u201d WFS method worked well to control segment piston to within 50 nm RMS and \u00b1 10\u03bcm dynamic range under simulated 0.6 arcsec atmospheric seeing (median seeing conditions at the GMT site). These results led to the inclusion of the HDFS as the official second channel piston sensor for the GMT NGWS WFS. This HDFS + PyWFS architecture should also work well to control piston petal modes on the ELT and TMT telescopes."}, {"paperId": "07399ac055f2f7b511db573287f7dbd9a05e022a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07399ac055f2f7b511db573287f7dbd9a05e022a", "title": "Global Daily Atmospheric State Profiles from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

With semiconductor technology gradually approaching its physical and thermal limits, recent supercomputers have adopted major\narchitectural changes to continue increasing the performance through more\npower-efficient heterogeneous many-core systems. Examples include Sunway\nTaihuLight that has four management processing elements (MPEs) and 256\ncomputing processing elements (CPEs) inside one processor and Summit that has\ntwo central processing units (CPUs) and six graphics processing units (GPUs)\ninside one node. Meanwhile, current high-resolution Earth system models that\ndesperately require more computing power generally consist of millions of\nlines of legacy code developed for traditional homogeneous multicore\nprocessors and cannot automatically benefit from the advancement of\nsupercomputer hardware. As a result, refactoring and optimizing the legacy\nmodels for new architectures become key challenges along the road of taking\nadvantage of greener and faster supercomputers, providing better support for\nthe global climate research community and contributing to the long-lasting\nsocietal task of addressing long-term climate change. This article reports\nthe efforts of a large group in the International Laboratory for\nHigh-Resolution Earth System Prediction (iHESP) that was established by the\ncooperation of Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and\nTechnology (QNLM), Texas A&M University (TAMU), and the National Center for\nAtmospheric Research (NCAR), with the goal of enabling highly efficient\nsimulations of the high-resolution (25\u2009km atmosphere and 10\u2009km ocean)\nCommunity Earth System Model (CESM-HR) on Sunway TaihuLight. The refactoring\nand optimizing efforts have improved the simulation speed of CESM-HR from 1\u2009SYPD (simulation years per day) to 3.4\u2009SYPD (with output disabled) and\nsupported several hundred years of pre-industrial control simulations. With\nfurther strategies on deeper refactoring and optimizing for remaining\ncomputing hotspots, as well as redesigning architecture-oriented\nalgorithms, we expect an equivalent or even better efficiency to be gained on the\nnew platform than traditional homogeneous CPU platforms. The refactoring and\noptimizing processes detailed in this paper on the Sunway system should have\nimplications for similar efforts on other heterogeneous many-core systems\nsuch as GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\n"}, {"paperId": "0762f3b2d7e00df3c338ef3f025041aec9305bc5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0762f3b2d7e00df3c338ef3f025041aec9305bc5", "title": "From a Love of Nature to a World of Earth Observations", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2022CN000165", "status": "CLOSED", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1029/2022CN000165?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1029/2022CN000165, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO-GAW) states in their 2018 final report that &#8220;the fate of the next generation of monitoring stations will be dramatically modified by the breakthroughs of new low-cost sensor (LCS) technologies.&#8221;. The development and improvement of low-cost technologies are proving notable applications and today LCSs are already playing a crucial role in fields such as model or emission validation and spatial variability of pollution[1]. Upcoming earth observation programmes, applications, services and support in citizen inclusion in earth monitoring are pushing the European Union (EU) in funding R&D to assess low-cost technologies, thus making the introduction of basic and applied research imperative.<br>PIONEER* aims at establishing a low-cost wireless sensor network (LCS-WSN) for the study of transboundary transport phenomena of air pollutants. Given its highly relevance for the Earth climate, ecosystems, and human health, primary endeavor will be directed towards the study of tropospheric ozone to obtain quantitative, reproducible in-situ measurements. Tropospheric ozone is one of the most important atmospheric gases involved in photochemical reactions[2], it plays a central role in the radiative budget of the atmosphere and it is the third greenhouse gas in the troposphere[3]. Also, surface ozone is a dangerous secondary pollutant causing harm to human health and ecosystems[4]. Since the troposphere is a very complex system the goal is to develop and deploy a reliable LCS-WSN, along the trail Munich-Venice, to be used by scientists as well as citizen engineers in remote areas, where the needs of reliable dense spatial data to model the transport phenomena and Climate Change effects is decisive.&#160;<br>PIONEER will exploit the existing open source technologies and commercial low-cost sensors to provide a LCS-WSN systems for long term climate data collection, a cloud-assisted database for time series collection and management, a web portal for uploading, displaying, performing statistical analysis and downloading records and metadata in a fully open access fashion, a comprehensive open source repository with tools, guidelines and application developed. The software will be open-source and released under copyleft license, thus allowing the complete reproducibility of all the developed devices and tools.&#160;</p><p>*Individual Global Fellowships granted by the Research Executive Agency.&#160;<br>Grant Agreement number: 844526 &#8212; PIONEER &#8212; H2020-MSCA-IF-2018</p><p>[1] Lewis, Alastair, W.

The pressure at altitudes can be tolerated with different materials based on requirement. These sensors are connected through a mini microcontroller and can be accessed easily. Instead of metallic cube boxes, either use polymers or graphite. The project provides low-cost and student friendly approach whereas we can access them remotely with the help of a drone. Here, the nano satellite is for student supportive and research purposes, where the goal is to capture, process and acquire geographical data.

Like in many current generations of climate models, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Earth System Model (CAS\u2010ESM2\u20100) simulated warmer SST in the eastern Pacific and colder SST in the central to western Pacific at the equator. We analyzed the physical processes causing these biases. We find that model biases in surface heat flux are a consequence, not the cause, of the SST bias. Ocean currents are implicated as the cause. The biases in ocean currents come from both the ocean model itself and the bias in surface winds in the atmospheric model. We show that the bias of ocean currents in the standalone ocean model causes warming in the region of positive precipitation bias in the standalone atmospheric model. When the two models are coupled, the precipitation bias is greatly amplified.

In this study, various ice particle habits are investigated in conjunction with inferring the optical properties of ice clouds for use in the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) satellite programme. We develop a database of the single-scattering properties of five ice habit models: plates, columns, droxtals, bullet rosettes, and Voronoi. The database is based on the specification of the Second Generation Global Imager (SGLI) sensor on board the GCOM-C satellite, which is scheduled to be launched in 2017 by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. A combination of the finite-difference time-domain method, the geometric optics integral equation technique, and the geometric optics method is applied to compute the single-scattering properties of the selected ice particle habits at 36 wavelengths, from the visible to the infrared spectral regions. This covers the SGLI channels for the size parameter, which is defined as a single-particle radius of an equivalent volume sphere, ranging between 6 and 9000\u202f\u00b5m. The database includes the extinction efficiency, absorption efficiency, average geometrical cross section, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry factor, size parameter of a volume-equivalent sphere, maximum distance from the centre of mass, particle volume, and six nonzero elements of the scattering phase matrix. The characteristics of calculated extinction efficiency, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor of the five ice particle habits are compared. Furthermore, size-integrated bulk scattering properties for the five ice particle habit models are calculated from the single-scattering database and microphysical data. Using the five ice particle habit models, the optical thickness and spherical albedo of ice clouds are retrieved from the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances-3 (POLDER-3) measurements, recorded on board the Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) satellite. The optimal ice particle habit for retrieving the SGLI ice cloud properties is investigated by adopting the spherical albedo difference (SAD) method. It is found that the SAD is distributed stably due to the scattering angle increases for bullet rosettes with an effective diameter (Deff) of 10\u202f\u00b5m and Voronoi particles with Deff values of 10, 60, and 100\u202f\u00b5m. It is confirmed that the SAD of small bullet-rosette particles and all sizes of Voronoi particles has a low angular dependence, indicating that a combination of the bullet-rosette and Voronoi models is sufficient for retrieval of the ice cloud's spherical albedo and optical thickness as effective habit models for the SGLI sensor. Finally, SAD analysis based on the Voronoi habit model with moderate particle size (Deff\u2009=\u200960\u202f\u00b5m) is compared with the conventional general habit mixture model, inhomogeneous hexagonal monocrystal model, five-plate aggregate model, and ensemble ice particle model. The Voronoi habit model is found to have an effect similar to that found in some conventional models for the retrieval of ice cloud properties from space-borne radiometric observations."}, {"paperId": "07ef0be27e680ce15c71a80e7aea0cf11d653164", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07ef0be27e680ce15c71a80e7aea0cf11d653164", "title": "How sensitive is our climate ?", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "08029ef74c95b7318a8be28b1d4483a2c0a9c35e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08029ef74c95b7318a8be28b1d4483a2c0a9c35e", "title": "The Bulletin Interviews: Professor H.

Quantitative radiometry of atomic oxygen via its visible and near-infrared transitions has been difficult, due to the complex excitation physics involved. OSAS-B is a heterodyne spectrometer for the thermally excited ground state transition of atomic oxygen at 4.75 THz. It will enable spectrally resolved measurements of the line shape, &#160;which in turn enables the determination of the concentration of atomic oxygen in the MLT. Due to water absorption, this line can only be observed from high-altitude platforms such as a high-flying airplanes, balloons or satellites. Recently the first spectrally resolved observation of the 4.75-THz line has been reported using a heterodyne spectrometer on SOFIA, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy [1]. Compared to SOFIA a balloon-borne instrument has the advantage of not being hampered by atmospheric water vapor absorption. OSAS-B will comprise a hot-electron bolometer mixer and a quantum-cascade laser as local oscillator in a combined helium/nitrogen dewar. A turning mirror will allow for sounding at different vertical inclinations. The&#160; first flight of OSAS-B is planned for autumn 2022 in the frame of the European HEMERA project [2].</p><p>[1] H.

The calculation models of Mars atmosphere loss, Mars sandstorm loss, solar scintillation loss, earth atmosphere absorption; rainfall loss and hot body noise are studied. The propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves in Mars atmosphere are analyzed and modeled by the characteristics of the propagation of analogous waves in the Earth's atmosphere. Ultimately, we found that the surface of the radio waves propagation environment is ideal, with less attenuation loss. Especially, the calculate model of solar scintillation loss and rainfall loss is simulated, and the simulation results are consistent with the actual statistical results, which proves the rationality of the calculate model. At last, an example of Mars-earth communication link budget is given. With the procedure, we can get one of the most important parameters of the link-Carrier to Noise Ratio, and we know the bit signal to noise ratio required by the right BER, then the maximum code rate of the link can be got. This paper has some reference to the design of Mars communication link. Introduction In the process of Mars detection, the deep space communication link is the link between the ground station and deep space probe, only to ensure the smooth flow of communication links, it may make the success of Mars exploration mission. Because the communication distance of Mars-Earth communication is long and the communication environment is bad, the design of communication system will be restricted. Only by studying the channel characteristics, the system plan and optimize of the Mars-earth communication link can be executed, and the key of designing a communication system is link budget and channel simulation. At the present stage, the main research in deep space communication focused on the lunar-earth communications and the moon surface communications, and research on the Mars-earth and Mars surface communication link budget is much less. In literature [1], the launch cruise and EDL (Entry, Down, Land) of the Mars Science Laboratory are introduced systematically. A more complete lunar-earth communication link budget method is given in literature [2]. In literature [3, 4], the solar scintillation of Mars communication was studied deeply. The radio propagation characteristics on the surface of Mars were studied in literature [5], and the calculation model of near-earth space rainfall attenuation was given in literature [6]. Literature [7] and [8] analysis the influence of the receiving antenna and cosmic noise on the communication performance. This paper summarizes the above research results, studies the Mars-Earth communication link budget method, and builds a link budget program with Microsoft Foundation Classes. Communication Link Analysis Mars-earth Communication Link. There are two types of communication between Mars detectors and earth stations. One is Direct to Earth (DTE) and the other is communication with earth stations through Mars relay satellites. For the deep space transmission link, we can divide it into three parts: the near-earth space propagation link, the interplanetary space propagation link and the target star space propagation link. We should consider the influence of the atmospheric and electromagnetic environments around the earth and the target star on the propagation of the signal.

Space agriculture, the cultivation of plants beyond Earth (particularly on the Moon and Mars), faces a constellation of interdependent environmental, biological, and engineering challenges. These include limited solar radiation, elevated ionizing radiation, large thermal variability, non-Earth atmospheric pressures, reduced gravity, regolith substrates with low nutrient-holding capacity, high-CO2/low-O2 atmospheres, pervasive dust, constrained water and nutrient availability, altered plant physiology, and the overarching need for closed-loop, resource-efficient systems. These stressors create an exceptionally challenging environment for plant growth and require tightly engineered agricultural systems. This review examines these constraints by organizing them across environmental differences, resource limitations, biological adaptation, and operational demands, emphasizing their systemic interdependence and the cascading effects that arise when one subsystem changes. By integrating findings from planetary science, plant biology, space systems engineering, biotechnology, robotics, and controlled-environment agriculture (CEA), the review outlines current limitations and highlights emerging strategies such as regolith utilization, advanced hydroponics, crop selection and genetic engineering, and the use of robotics, sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) for monitoring and automation.

It is possible, therefore, that early Mars could have been hospitable for microorganisms.</p>\n<p>While cellular degeneration is a rapid process following cell death, microorganisms do leave behind molecular clues as to their existence, or biosignatures, such as the lipid molecules that previously comprised their cell membranes. Each group of microorganisms leaves behind a distinct lipid &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; that is relatively resistant to harsh environmental conditions and can be preserved over geological timescales<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>Various robotic and remote-sensing missions have confirmed the presence of salt deposits (e.g., chlorides, sulfates) at the late Noachian to late Hesperian (~ 4 to 3.5 Ga) boundaries of present-day Martian deposits. In particular, bulk enrichments of calcium and magnesium sulfates have been reported in the Hesperian (~ 3.3&#8211;3.7 Ga) sedimentary rocks of Gale crater<sup>3</sup>, which indicate the previous presence of widespread liquid water on Mars. On Earth, such salts have been found to harbour and protect microbial life for a prolonged period, possibly over millions of years<sup>4</sup>, thus evaporite sequences provide a compelling target for life detection, as putative biosignatures could be preserved<sup>5</sup>.</p>\n<p>Currently, the beneficial or deleterious effects of sulfate chemistry on the preservation of organic matter, especially under biologically destructive modern Martian conditions is not well constrained. Given the prominent presence of sulfates on the surface of Mars, this work explores whether sulfate minerals can act as viable substrates for the long-term preservation of lipids, when exposed to Mars-like radiative and atmospheric conditions, and aims to determine whether those signs of life can be explicitly detected.</p>\n<p>To carry out this work, we use a combination of analogue fieldwork and laboratory-based simulation studies. Microorganisms isolated from a magnesium sulfate-rich analogue site (Basque Lake) and other terrestrial early Mars analogues, will be entombed within artificial sulfate crystals by evaporating an experimental brine under low atmospheric pressure and UV radiation similar to that encountered on the surface of Mars using The Open University&#8217;s Mars chamber facility. The lipids within the samples will be extracted and derivatized to make them amenable to by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GC-MS); py-GC-MS is an important component of the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite onboard NASA&#8217;s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and of the Mars Organic Molecular Organizer (MOMA) on the ESA&#8217;s Rosalind Franklin (ExoMars) rover. This work will aid in characterizing the impacts of the simulated Martian environment and Martian mineralogy on the preservation and detection of lipid biomarkers within sulfitic evaporite deposits and will inform the robotic missions targeting the search for ancient signatures of life on Mars.</p>\n<p><strong>References: </strong>[1] Carr MH, Head JW (2010) Earth and Planetary Science Letters 294: 185-203 [2] Luo G et al., (2019) Earth-Science Reviews 189: 99-124 [3] Rapin, W et al., (2019) Nature Geosciences 12:889&#8211;895 [4] Fendrihan S et al., (2006) Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology 5: 203-218 [5] Johnson SS et al., (2020) Astrobiology 2020 20:167-178</p>"}, {"paperId": "088358e61bd18c6ed816df51dcc215b08045dbae", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/088358e61bd18c6ed816df51dcc215b08045dbae", "title": "Editorial: Acidification and Hypoxia in Marginal Seas", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.861850/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fmars.2022.861850?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.861850, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It shall demonstrate the potential of high spectral resolution Doppler Wind lidars for operational measurements of wind profiles and their use in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Spin-off products are profiles of cloud and aerosol optical properties. ADM-Aeolus carries the novel Doppler Wind lidar instrument ALADIN.Recently the two ALADIN laser transmitters were successfully qualified and delivered for further instrument integration. The instrument delivery will follow later this year and the satellite qualification and launch readiness is scheduled for 2016.In February 2015, an Aeolus Science and Calibration and Validation (CAL/VAL) Workshop was held in ESA-ESRIN, Frascati, Italy, bringing industry, the user community and ESA together to prepare for the Aeolus Commissioning and Operational Phases. During the Workshop the science, instrument and product status, commissioning phase planning and the extensive number of proposals submitted in response to the Aeolus CAL/VAL call in 2014 were presented and discussed. A special session was dedicated to the Aeolus CAL/VAL Implementation Plan.In this paper, the Aeolus mission, status and launch preparation activities are described."}, {"paperId": "08eb376f728578e4e966d20596b5e3b74ee02650", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08eb376f728578e4e966d20596b5e3b74ee02650", "title": "Satellite Gravity Gradiometry with GOCE", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Brock, Ilann Bourgeois, Donald R. Blake, Eric C. Apel, and Thomas B. Ryerson, which was first published February 18, 2020; 10.1073/pnas.1919344117 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117, 4505\u20134510). The authors note that \u201chydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF) mixing ratios have been reduced, based upon recent experimental work that has identified a correction to the calibration method used to determine the instrument sensitivity for HPMTF measurements during ATom-3 and ATom-4. In the original calibration procedure, described in SI Appendix, section 1, HPMTF was produced using Cl\u2022 radical reaction with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). The measured change in Cl2 was used to determine HPMTF production; however, a contaminant yielded an overestimation in the measured Cl\u2022 radical concentration. More recent and more accurate actinometry of the produced Cl radicals has shown that instrument sensitivity to HPMTF was underestimated in these initial experiments. \u201cHPMTF mixing ratios published in this manuscript are corrected by applying a project average scaling factor of 0.62 \u00b1 0.11 (1 s) to the observations. The publicly available dataset has been updated through the Distributed Active Archive Center for Biogeochemical Dynamics (1). The HPMTF uncertainties have also been updated and are now reported for 1-s data to be 17% + 0.3 ppt accuracy and 0.4 ppt precision for ATom-3 and 12% + 0.4 ppt accuracy and 0.3 ppt precision for ATom-4.\u201d As a result of this change, Figs. 1\u20134 have been updated. The corrected figures and their legends appear below. Also as a result of this change, the authors note that some text in the main article and SI Appendix should be corrected. On page 4506, right column, first paragraph, line 6, \u201cDetection limits were better than 1 parts per trillion as a mole fraction in dry air (ppt), with an uncertainty of 55% + 0.06 ppt and a precision of 0.1 ppt for 1-s measurements (details in SI Appendix)\u201d should instead appear as \u201cDetection limits were better than 1 parts per trillion as a mole fraction in dry air (ppt), with an uncertainty of 17% + 0.4 ppt and a precision of 0.4 ppt for 1-s measurements (details in SI Appendix).\u201d On the same page, right column, first full paragraph, line 8, \u201cHPMTF is globally ubiquitous in the lower atmosphere over both seasons sampled, withMBLmixing ratios frequently exceeding 50 ppt and periodically as large as several hundred ppt (Fig. 2)\u201d should instead appear as \u201cHPMTF is globally ubiquitous in the lower atmosphere over both seasons sampled, withMBLmixing ratios frequently exceeding 10 ppt and periodically as large as 100 ppt (Fig. 2).\u201d Also on the same page, right column, second full paragraph, line 6, \u201cHPMTFwas typically observed in a 1:1 ratio with DMS in the MBL; however, values in excess of 2:1 were frequently encountered. For example, the largest HPMTF mixing ratios of more than 300 ppt were observed over the South Atlantic Ocean (46\u00b0S and 53\u00b0W) during ATom-3\u201d should instead appear as \u201cHPMTF was typically observed in a 0.5:1 ratio with DMS in the MBL; however, values in excess of 1:1 were periodically encountered. For example, the largest HPMTF mixing ratios of more than 150 ppt were observed over the South Atlantic Ocean (46\u00b0S and 53\u00b0W) during ATom-3.\u201d In the SI Appendix, the authors note that \u201cwe originally stated that \u2018Cl2 quantification is possible using the iodide CIMS instrumentation (6) allowing for the determination of Cl\u2022 concentration following photolysis\u2019 and later stated \u2018Under these conditions we assume that the concentration of HPMTF produced is equivalent to twice the measured concentration of Cl2 lost via photolysis.\u2019 In the updated calibration procedure, the change in Cl2, from photolytic loss and subsequent reaction with DMS, is below the detection limit of the instrument. For quantification of Cl\u2022 concentration we utilize a more accurate actinometry of chlorine radicals.\u201d Panel A of Fig. S8 has been removed. Therefore, the following statement is no longer applicable: \u201cFig. S8A shows an example of a calibration experiment where loss of Cl2 is accompanied by an increase in HPMTF during photolysis.\u201d These sentences have been omitted in the updated SI Appendix. On page 4, second full paragraph, line 1, \u201cAn absolute sensitivity of 2.4 \u00b1 1.2 Hz ppt was determined for the detection of HPMTF using iodide-adduct TOF CIMS in ATom. This sensitivity is about 5x less than the most sensitive compounds (e.g. Cl2, ClNO2, N2O5) and similar to that for BrO\u201d should instead appear as \u201cThe average normalized instrument sensitivity to the detection of HPMTF using iodide-adduct TOF CIMS was 9.0 \u00b1 3.2 (1\u03c3) Hz ppt, normalized to 1MHz IH2O \u2212 averaged across ATom-3 and ATom-4. This sensitivity is similar to the most sensitive compounds (e.g. Cl2, ClNO2, N2O5).\u201d In addition, the following changes have been made to the SI Appendix reference list: The authors note that ref. 6 \u201cwas used to establish the mass spectrometer as a quantitative method for Cl2 measurement. The updated calibration procedure no longer utilizes the observed change in Cl2 as a method for quantification of Cl radicals (Cl\u2022) production; therefore, the reference is no longer relevant to the manuscript.\u201dRef. 6 has been removed. Citations for refs. 57\u201359 were out of order and appeared earlier in the SI than indicated. The citations have been renumbered and refs. 57\u201359 now appear as references 19\u201321. Furthermore, refs. 50 and 61 were duplicated and have now been combined into a single ref. 52. The SI Appendix reference list has been renumbered to reflect these changes. Lastly, Figs. S1, S2, S5, and S8 are also affected by the correction to HPMTF data. The legend for Fig. S8 has been updated to reflect the changes. The online version has been updated to include the corrected text described above, the corrected Figs. 1\u20134, and the corrected SI Appendix."}, {"paperId": "08ff442aa48d7d3fb6b0c817e868fabbe006f0fa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08ff442aa48d7d3fb6b0c817e868fabbe006f0fa", "title": "NASA Global Hawk: Project Overview and Future Plans", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "96503074", "name": "J.

However, there are few proxies sensitive enough to quantify O2 at the low levels present until slightly less than 1 billion years ago. Lu et al. measured iodine/calcium ratios in marine carbonates, which are a proxy for dissolved oxygen concentrations in the upper ocean. They found that a major, but temporary, rise in atmospheric O2 occurred at around 400 million years ago and that O2 levels underwent a step change to near-modern values around 200 million years ago. Science, this issue p. 174 The I/Ca ratio in marine carbonates tracks atmospheric oxygen levels for the past 2.5 billion years. Rising oceanic and atmospheric oxygen levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the oxygenation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago."}, {"paperId": "091e2706cad18a202ae62c86c9654ad9e3631164", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/091e2706cad18a202ae62c86c9654ad9e3631164", "title": "Lidar Remote Sensing Applications: Ready and Waiting", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In this paper, bibliometric analysis was used to study the publication output and hotspots of BVOCs emissions research from 1991 to 2019. Then, the evolutionary trends in BVOCs emission sources research were explored further by combining evolution tree and Markov chain methods. We found that the USA consistently took the leading position in BVOCs research, which cooperated with Germany and China closely. Environmental Science & Ecology and Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences were the most active research subject categories. Current literatures mainly focused on the plant stress response, the atmospheric chemistry of BVOCs emissions, and their measurement by field determination and model-based estimation. Most publications researched BVOCs emitted by plants, in particular Pinaceae, while the growth of publications researching microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) was slow. In the future, we should consider the role of mVOCs and combine field observation with model estimation to improve the credibility of BVOCs estimates and provide scientific guidance for air pollution control. And, with climate change, it will be worth exploring the driving variables of BVOCs emissions and its interaction in earth system to unravel how BVOCs emissions will respond to the changing earth system."}, {"paperId": "09342f22c25b07bd5ec678ad3f20dc164821e9ea", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09342f22c25b07bd5ec678ad3f20dc164821e9ea", "title": "Relative Humidity Dependence of Light Extinction by Mixed Organic/Sulfate Particles", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

A total of 112 broadband stations were deployed as three separate subarrays in two separate mobilizations. Each subarray recorded local, regional, and teleseismic earthquakes for a 21-month period. Although the primary purpose of the array is to characterize the lithosphere and sublithospheric mantle, the array recorded a number of events of potential interest to the broader geoscience community including the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion, North Korean nuclear tests, the deep Mw 8.3 Sea of Okhotsk earthquake, and large megathrust events offshore Chile and in Nepal. The array includes the first dense deployment of seismometers across the Hangay dome, a region previously believed to be relatively aseismic serving as a rigid block focusing strain to the west and south along the Mongolian and Gobi-Altai. Initial results from local earthquakes recorded by the array suggest that the Hangay is deforming rather than behaving as a rigid block and that the earthquake potential of faults within the Hangay should be incorporated in hazard analysis for Mongolia.

INTRODUCTION Mongolia sits deep in the Asian continental interior between the Siberian craton to the north, the diffuse northern edge of deformation associated with the India\u2013Asia collision to the south, and far-field subduction of the Pacific plate to the east (Fig. 1). Central and western Mongolia constitute a significant portion of the greater Mongolian plateau, an \u223c2:6 million km2 area of central Asia with an average elevation of \u223c1500 m. High-elevation low-relief surfaces are common on continents but are not predicted by plate tectonics. The origin and persistence of continental plateaus through time provides insight into the evolution of continents and interactions between mantle dynamics and surface processes. These large-scale topographic features impact the geologic record, climate, and biogeography. The high topography of the Mongolian plateau has been attributed to far-field effects of India\u2013Asia convergence, Pacific plate subduction, mantle plume activity, convective mantle flow, and magmatic underplating (Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Windley and Allen, 1993; Cunningham, 2001; Petit et al., 2002, 2008; Yanovskaya and Kozhevnikov, 2003; Bayasgalan et al., 2005; Zorin et al., 2006). Within central Mongolia, the broad domal Hangay upland (\u223c200; 000 km2) is embedded in the greater Mongolian plateau. Elevations within the Hangay average 2500 m, approximately 1000 m above the regional trend. Locally, the highest peak Otgontenger reaches just over 4000 m. The drainage divide in the Hangay separates rivers flowing north to the Arctic Ocean from those flowing into internally drained basins to the west and south. A kinematic transition between predominantly compressional deformation to the south and extension adjacent to the Siberian craton takes place in Mongolia. In western Mongolia, northward-directed shortening related to the India\u2013Asia collision decreases from south to north from \u223c10 mm=yr south of the Altai, to\u223c4 mm=year in the Altai, and to 0 on the Siberian craton (Calais et al., 2003). Central and eastern Mongolia moves eastward at \u223c4mm=yr (Calais et al., 2003). Major strike-slip faults within Mongolia accommodate the transition from shortening to extension and give rise to the Mongolian 1364 Seismological Research Letters Volume 90, Number 3 May/June 2019 doi: 10.1785/0220180360 Downloaded from http://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-pdf/90/3/1364/4686492/srl-2018360.1.pdf by Missouri University of Science and Technology user on 07 December 2021 and Gobi-Altai ranges. The Bulnay and Gobi-Altai fault systems have sustained some of the largest recorded intracontinental earthquakes, four events M \u2265 8:0 within a 53 yr period in the early-to-mid-1900s (Tapponnier and Molnar, 1979; Khil\u2019ko et al., 1985; Baljinnyam et al., 1993; Schlupp and Cisternas, 2007). Extension is accommodated by the Baikal, Tunka, Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l, Darkhad, and Busiingol rifts that wrap around the southern and eastern margin of the Siberian craton (Fig. 1). Mongolia has a complex geologic history. The crust is composed of Archean to early Proterozoic crystalline rocks modified by Paleozoic accretionary events associated with formation of the central Asian orogenic belt, a protracted and significant period of continental growth involving the opening and closing of ocean basins in the Neoproterozoic and early Phanerozoic (1000\u2013250Ma; \u015eeng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Badarch et al., 2002; Jahn, 2004; Windley et al., 2007; Wilhem et al., 2012). The accreted terranes of Mongolia sit between the Siberian craton to the north and the Tarim and North China cratons to the south. Younger Cenozoic deformation and basalt volcanism continues today. The elevated low-relief landscape hosts a 30 Ma record of intermittent basalt magmatism sourced from the sublithospheric mantle (Barry et al., 2003; Yarmolyuk et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2012; Ancuta et al., 2014; Carlson and Ionov, 2014; Ancuta et al., 2018). A number of these basalts contain mantle and lower crustal xenoliths (Stosch et al., 1995; Ionov, 2007; Carlson and Ionov, 2014). As part of a larger multidisciplinary project investigating the origin of high topography in continental interiors, we deployed temporary broadband seismic stations from 2012 to 2016 to determine the structure and composition of the lithosphere and sublithospheric mantle beneath the region. The deployment is a collaborative effort between Lehigh University, the University of Florida, and the Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The central Mongolia seismic experiment consists of 112 broadband seismic stations in two separate deployments covering an \u223c900 \u00d7 600 km region in central Mongolia (Fig. 1). Although the primary purpose of the seismic experiment is to look at crustal and upper-mantle structure, the data recorded by the array are applicable to a number of studies. Local and regional earthquakes recorded by the array can be used to improve seismic hazard assessment in Mongolia. Data recorded by the array fill a significant gap in existing regional velocity and attenuation tomographic models for central and eastern Asia and can be used to improve geodynamic models and nuclear monitoring capabilities in this part of the world. Central Mongolia is antipodal to South America providing a window into deep Earth structure (Rial and Cormier, 1980; Butler et al., 1986; Poupinet et al., 1993; Butler and Tsuboi, 2010; Retailleau et al., 2014). Data recorded by the array have the potential to contribute to studies of surface and atmospheric processes. A number of the stations are located along rivers in the Hangay and Altai ranges and can be used to study fluvial processes and erosion (Burtin et al., 2008; Hsu et al., 2011; Schmandt et al., 2013; Roth et al., 2014). Central Mongolia is a major site of cyclogenesis in the lee of the Sayan, Hangay, and Altai ranges linked to loess deposition in China and midwinter storms in the North Pacific (Chung et al., 1976; Adachi and Kimura, 2007; Roe, 2009; Penny et al., 2010; Caves et al., 2015). Within the time period of the two deployments that make up the central Mongolia seismic experiment, we recorded a number of significant events: the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion in 2013, nuclear \u25b4 Figure 1.

These phenomena are often difficult to study since measurements are typically irregular in time and space due to geographic constraints for deploying ground instruments and the natural orbital motion of satellites. This frequently precludes Fourier methods such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from being used. The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) provides FFT-like analysis when measurements are irregular. To our knowledge, all prior use of the LSP in space science has been one-dimensional. This paper uses a N-Dimensional extension of the LSP (ND LSP) to study traveling ionospheric disturbances in four dimensions on a quiescent day near solar minimum. We use an exquisite dataset consisting of 12 ionosondes over Australia on June 29, 2019. The ND LSP resolves the full 3-dimensional wave vector as well as the period for many discrete TIDs. To the degree possible, we validate our findings from ionosonde data processed with the ND LSP by using an FFT-based method on line-of-sight TEC data from the same period and find similar wavelengths and periods for the large TIDs. We show that TIDs occur preferentially near 70o elevation and could be missed or mischaracterized if using TEC data in the thin-shell approximation."}, {"paperId": "0a4812f021d58727f5b9c4097da0e762b56a7c5c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a4812f021d58727f5b9c4097da0e762b56a7c5c", "title": "Optimal experiment design for time-lapse traveltime tomography - eScholarship", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398294686", "name": "J.

Ariel is an ESA mission that will use the transit spectroscopy method to observe the atmospheres of nominally ~1000 exoplanets. Ariel is a 1 m class cryogenic (\u223c 40 K) space telescope that will be placed in a halo orbit around the Earth-Sun L2 point. To detect atmospheric molecular absorption features, Ariel will produce medium-resolution spectra (R \u2265 15) using three spectroscopic channels covering 1.1 \u2013 7.9 \u03bcm as well as having photometric channels covering 0.5 \u2013 1.1 \u03bcm. To achieve Ariel\u2019s science goals, the payload requires detailed calibration and performance verification. The payload-level performance verification of the Ariel payload will take place in 2026 in a 5-meter vacuum chamber at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory\u2019s Space Instruments Test Facility. The payload will be enclosed in a Cryogenic Test Rig (CTR) to provide a space-like (~35 K) thermal environment and is illuminated by the OGSE. The OGSE provides point as well as extended source illumination across Ariel\u2019s full wavelength range. The OGSE design also includes a series of mechanisms and features to enable the various illumination conditions required to test Ariel. Here we report design updates to the OGSE after a preliminary design review (PDR). Since PDR, there have been substantial revisions to the OGSE architecture. In this proceeding, we describe the evolution of the OGSE architecture. The updated OGSE design will then be presented."}, {"paperId": "0a6d0c2bd6fca28e0a76366fe4489d7882c5a87a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a6d0c2bd6fca28e0a76366fe4489d7882c5a87a", "title": "Toward New Inferences about Cloud Structures from Multidirectional Measurements in the Oxygen A Band: Middle-of-Cloud Pressure and Cloud Geometrical Thickness from POLDER-3/PARASOL", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1175/2010jamc2550.1", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "unspecified-oa", "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

A great body of scientific evidence shows that climate change is, in part, caused by anthropogenic activities. The start of the industrial revolution, around 1750, intensified the rate of growth of GHGs\u2019 concentration in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The increased atmospheric GHGs\u2019 concentration has, undoubtedly, accelerated changes in Earth\u2019s climate, which in turn, caused an increase of global land, ocean, and air temperatures. This global temperature rise is noticeably impacting natural and human systems alike. Scientists, stakeholders, social and political personalities have demanded governments and other organizations at local, national and supranational levels to accept their responsibility and undertake decisive actions to mitigate climate change and its impacts. At present, one of the main goals of humankind, to minimize or avoid catastrophic climate-related disasters, is to keep earth\u2019s warming below 2\u2218 C compared to pre-industrial levels. In this context, the international community has responded in different ways to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. This paper presents a brief review of the literature of the science of climate change and the global political response. Science and political response must go hand in hand to fight climate change and its impacts. This paper also provides an account of the establishment of different key scientific and political organizations aimed to mitigate climate change. \nPalabras clave: Cambio Climatico, Ciencia Medioambiental, Politica Medioambiental. \nKeywords: Climate Change, Environmental Science, Environmental Policy."}, {"paperId": "0ab8e5aecd3a593f9caaf2702360615268d279ba", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ab8e5aecd3a593f9caaf2702360615268d279ba", "title": "Science behind sensing hydrocarbon seepage using X-band radar", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1476624957", "name": "T.

Technologies which might be deployed to attempt geoengineering are either speculative or only in the very early stages of development. Those currently being considered fall into two main camps. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) techniques aim to decrease climate change by withdrawing significant amounts of carbon dioxide, the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. Proposed methods include direct air capture, ocean fertilization, enhanced weathering, and large-scale afforestation. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) technologies endeavor to offset the warming effects of rising greenhouse concentrations by decreasing the amount of energy the Earth\u2019s surface receives from the Sun, usually through increasing the planet\u2019s albedo (i.e. its reflectivity). In the early literature, the techniques attracting most attention are spraying sulfate particles in the stratosphere (stratospheric sulfate injection or \u2018SSI\u2019) and marine cloud brightening (\u2018MCB\u2019). Other possibilities include making deserts, oceans and roofs more reflective. Despite their speculative nature, discussion of geoengineering technologies is growing rapidly in science and policy circles. Having for decades largely been dismissed as irrelevant or counterproductive to serious discussion, some now advocate for geoengineering techniques as possible \u2018tools in the toolkit\u2019 for future climate action. This \u2018partial mainstreaming\u2019 began in 2006 when Paul Crutzen, a prominent atmospheric chemist, argued that serious research was needed because of ongoing political inertia on reducing global emissions (Crutzen, 2006). Crutzen\u2019s focus was on stratospheric sulfate injection. He stressed that SSI was \u2018by far not the best solution\u2019 (212) and that \u2018the very best would be if emissions of the greenhouse gases could be reduced so much that the stratospheric sulfur release experiment would not need to take place\u2019 (217). However, he also insisted that \u2018currently, this looks like a pious wish\u2019 (217). Crutzen\u2019s intervention was controversial in the science community. Nevertheless, in the intervening decade or so, discussion of geoengineering has developed at a considerable pace. In particular, a number of reports from scientific academies (e.g. Royal Society, 2009; National Research Council, 2015) and policy institutes (e.g. Bipartisan Policy Center 2011; FCEA 2018) have emerged.

We present scientific results from 10\u00a0years of tropospheric column ozone (TCO) data derived from combined EPIC and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA-2) ozone data. We use the EPIC TCO to characterize variabilities in tropospheric ozone from daily to decadal timescales. We also use EPIC TCO with hourly sampling to evaluate the geostationary measurements of total and tropospheric ozone from the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instrument.

In order to evaluate the differences among different SDL products quantitatively, we have selected three commonly used SDL products\u2014Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System-Synoptic Radiative Fluxes and Clouds (CERES-SYN), the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts-Surface Radiation Budget (ECMWF-SRB) and the Global Energy and Water Exchanges Project-Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB)\u2014to comprehensively study in this paper. The results show that there are significant differences among the three SDL products in some areas, such as in the Arctic, the Antarctic, the Sahara, the Tibet Plateau, and Greenland. The maximum absolute root mean square error (RMSEab) in these areas is greater than 20 Wm\u22122, the maximum relative root mean square error (RMSEre) is greater than 20%, the maximum and minimum absolute mean bias error (MBEab) are about 20 Wm\u22122 and \u221220 Wm\u22122, respectively, and the maximum and minimum relative mean bias error (MBEre) are about 10% and \u221210%, respectively. Among the three SDL products, the difference between the ECMWF-SRB and GEWEX-SRB is the most significant. In addition, this paper also analyzed the differences among different SDL products based on three aspects. Firstly, the differences among the three SDL products show that there is significant seasonality, and the differences among different months may vary greatly. However, the differences are not sensitive to years. Secondly, there are some differences in cloud-forcing radiative fluxes (CFRFs) of different SDL products, which is also an important factor affecting the difference between different SDL products. Finally, in the process of converting high temporal resolution SDL products into monthly SDL products, data processing also affects the difference between different SDL products."}, {"paperId": "0afd2162e11a3a338259092f37b680ee058eb89c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0afd2162e11a3a338259092f37b680ee058eb89c", "title": "Low SWaP hyperspectral imaging sensor for CubeSat applications", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1117/12.2633886?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2633886, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To assess the current state of the atmosphere and its rate of degradation, the monitoring of atmospheric gasses and particulates is necessary. The development of next-generation Low size, weight, and power (SWaP) sensors and instruments which are required for this task is a high priority for NASA\u2019s Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO). The primary tool to monitor atmospheric gasses is hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Current HSI systems are composed of a large and complex assortment of lenses, filters and cameras that are large, heavy, expensive, and intolerant to physical shocks\u2014all things that make them challenging for use in space-based sensing and imaging applications. As an alternative, a Low SWaP sensor is made possible by integrating a compact HSI sensor onto a CubeSat or SmallSat platform, which is much cheaper to deploy vs. a conventional satellite. To facilitate this, metamaterials are employed at the detector level to reduce the optical components required for HSI, while still providing comparable performance. The metamaterial studied here replaces a conventional grating disperser in a HSI system, by being compatible with a focused beam (fast optics) while spectrally filtering a particular spectral channel."}, {"paperId": "0b0082ee9e03b2e396c37f746b62bfcd241680bb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b0082ee9e03b2e396c37f746b62bfcd241680bb", "title": "Partly Cloudy with a Chance of Migration: Weather, Radars, and Aeroecology", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1175/bams-d-11-00099.1", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "unspecified-oa", "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

This community-driven effort builds on successes of the past and aims to grow and be more inclusive by involving additional local, regional, national, and international cyberinfrastructure and research computing partners spanning academia, government, and industry. The PEARC conference series is working to integrate and meet the collective interests of our growing community. PEARC originated from the XSEDE conference series, which showcased the discoveries, innovations, challenges, and achievements of those who use and support NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources and services, as well as other digital resources and services throughout the world. The following papers represent the best papers from the transitionary conferences of this research community: XSEDE16, the final XSEDE conference, and PEARC17, the inaugural PEARC conference. These papers capture both important research contributions to the advanced computing community and best practices for advanced computing systems and remote user interfaces. These three papers cover a diverse set of topics: the impact of science gateways, innovative hardware impacting cyberinfrastructure, and improving computational frameworks with workflows, machine learning, and visualizations. The paper by Hu et al 1 discusses how geospatial data have exploded to massive volume and diversity and subsequently cause serious usability issues for researchers in various scientific areas. This paper describes TopoLens, a cyberGIS community data service framework to facilitate geospatial big data access, processing, and sharing based on a hybrid supercomputer architecture. TopoLens delivers community data services developed for easy and efficient access to high-resolution topographic data. It supports on-demand data and map services, powered by hybrid cyberinfrastructure with cloud and HPC support, to efficiently produce datasets that are customized based on a user's request. The usability of TopoLens has been acknowledged in the topographic user community evaluation. The paper by Hancock et al 2 dives into Jetstream, the NSF's first distributed production cloud resource. Jetstream offers a unique capability within the XSEDE-supported US national cyberinfrastructure, delivering interactive virtual machines (VMs) via the atmosphere interface. As a multi-region deployment that operates as an integrated system, Jetstream is proving effective in supporting modes and disciplines of research traditionally underrepresented on larger XSEDE-supported clusters and supercomputers. Jetstream has been used to perform research and education in biology, biochemistry, atmospheric science, earth science, and computer science."}, {"paperId": "0b11a5ccda59a28710fd7588f79c725592b9d5c4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b11a5ccda59a28710fd7588f79c725592b9d5c4", "title": "A 340 GHz cryogenic amplifier based spectrometer for space based atmospheric science applications", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black\u2010carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom\u2010up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr\u22121 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial\u2010era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m\u22122 with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m\u22122. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m\u22122. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial\u2010era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m\u22122 with 90% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m\u22122. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co\u2010emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m\u22122, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present\u2010day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short\u2010lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co\u2010emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short\u2010lived co\u2010emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy\u2010related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial\u2010era climate forcing of +0.22 (\u22120.50 to +1.08) W m\u22122 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short\u2010lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial\u2010era climate forcing by all short\u2010lived species from black\u2010carbon\u2010rich sources becomes slightly negative (\u22120.06 W m\u22122 with 90% uncertainty bounds of \u22121.45 to +1.29 W m\u22122). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black\u2010carbon\u2010rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co\u2010emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black\u2010carbon mitigation actions, non\u2010science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near\u2010term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black\u2010carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates."}, {"paperId": "0b5e03a9a9ad8898c338d3cbbbfaf29712a3e9ca", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b5e03a9a9ad8898c338d3cbbbfaf29712a3e9ca", "title": "Polen and spores as cloud condensation nuclei: results from a laboratory experiment", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/EGUSPHERE-EGU21-12163?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/EGUSPHERE-EGU21-12163, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On the one hand, these particles are able to modify atmospheric optical properties, causing a significant impact on Earth&#8217;s energy balance, and consequently their presence is fundamental on the global climate. On the other hand, aerosol particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN); making them an essential part of the hydrological cycle.</p><p>Atmospheric aerosols can be grouped into two categories depending on their origin: natural or anthropogenic. In our study, we put the focus on atmospheric aerosols of natural origin, in particular on primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) such as pollen and spores. These biogenic particles are released in large quantities from terrestrial vegetation into the atmosphere, where they can be transported up to 100-1000 km. Due to their large size (between 10-100 &#181;m pollen grains and 2-10 &#181;m spores) their residence time in the atmosphere is short. For this reason, they are not climate relevant compared to other components in the atmosphere. However, under moist and high humidity conditions or mechanical processes these biological aerosol particles can break into smaller particles known as sub-pollen particles (SPP) and sub-spores particles (SSP). Each pollen grain can rupture releasing a large quantity of these type of sub-particles (10<sup>6</sup>). Wozniak et al. (2018) estimated that, for clean background conditions, high SPPs concentrations can suppress average seasonal precipitation by 32% and shift rates from heavy to light while increasing dry days.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the ability of various pollen and spores types to break into sub-particles and be activated as CCN. To this end we used a CCN counter (CCN-100, DMT) coupled with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS, TSI) to select SPPs and SSPs of 50, 100 and 200 nm. The results show that not all pollen types have the same activation properties, with critical supersaturations varying between species and particle size. Additionally, SEM images have been performed to confirm the rupture of pollen and spores particles into SPPs and SSPs, respectively. Chemical composition of the different species have been investigated as well.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>References:</p><p>Wozniak,M. C., Solmon, F., & Steiner, A. L. (2018).

This new model with complex and detailed surface conditions, called TEB-RAMS, is from Colorado State University (CSU) and the ASTER division of Mission Research Corporation. The spatial-temporal distributions of daily mean 2\u2009m air temperature are simulated by TEB-RAMS during the period from 0000 UTC 01 to 0000 UTC 02 July 2003 over the area of 116\u00b0E~116.8\u00b0E, 39.6\u00b0N~40.2\u00b0N in Beijing. The TEB-RAMS was run with four levels of two-way nested grids, and the finest grid is at 1\u2009km grid increment. An Anthropogenic Heat (AH) source is introduced into TEB-RAMS. A comparison between the Land Ecosystem-Atmosphere Feedback model (LEAF) and the detailed TEB parameterization scheme is presented. The daily variations and spatial distribution of the 2\u2009m air temperature agree well with the observations of the Beijing area. The daily mean 2\u2009m air temperature simulated by TEB-RAMS with the AH source is 0.6\u2009K higher than that without specifying TEB and AH over the metropolitan area of Beijing. The presence of urban underlying surfaces plays an important role in the UHI formation. The geometric morphology of an urban area characterized by road, roof, and wall also seems to have notable effects on the UHI intensity. Furthermore, the land-use dataset from USGS is replaced in the model by a new land-use map for the year 2010 which is produced by the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The simulated regional mean 2\u2009m air temperature is 0.68\u2009K higher from 01 to 02 July 2003 with the new land cover map."}, {"paperId": "0b71f8a9439648e194aae0181131d470828d6bb1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b71f8a9439648e194aae0181131d470828d6bb1", "title": "Earth System Grid Center for Enabling Technologies: Building a Global Infrastructure for Climate Change Research", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115971778", "name": "Dean N.

In addition to making their mark in their fields of knowledge, key figures in Western culture, such as Kant, Humboldt and Goethe, contributed greatly to the advancement of natural sciences, particularly atmospheric science. Goethe stands out for his work on barometric measurements, his knowledge of clouds and his ideas on the movement of the air. His justification of atmospheric dynamics based on internal causes of the Earth was quickly dismissed in light of the air physics discoveries taking place at the time. He was passionate about the shapes of clouds and the form of the sky, which he described and drew. His literary work is replete with references to the atmosphere. This study analyses the meteorological writings of Goethe, examining his contributions to the atmospheric sciences of his day and how his passion for the skies and clouds permeated his literary works.

Sea surface height (SSH) is determined by advanced satellite remote sensing in the fields of earth sciences, such as geophysics, geodesy, and oceanography.

The assemblage from the Apium-1 core was recovered from an ca 5-m-thick interval (2756.35\u20132751.28 m) in the basal Hovea Member (\u2018inertinitic interval\u2019) of the Kockatea Shale and includes the following forms: ?Spinomarginifera sp., Cimmeriella sp., ?Etherilosia sp., Elivina sp., Cleiothyridina sp., and Paeckelmanelloidea gen. et. sp. indet. (all brachiopods). The age of this assemblage is interpreted as Changhsingian, as constrained by its association with the palynofloral Dulhuntyispora parvithola Zone. The assemblage from the Redback-2 core was recovered from the \u2018sapropelic interval\u2019 of the Hovea Member of the Kockatea Shale between 3806\u2009m and 3786\u2009m and comprises the following forms: Lingulidae gen. et sp. indet. (brachiopod), Claraia perthensis Dickins & McTavish, Crittendenia cf. australasiatica (Krumbeck), ?Paralledon sp. (bivalves), ?Otoceras sp. (ammonoid), Microconchus utahensis Zato\u0144, Taylor & Vinn (microconchid) and Magniestheria mangaliensis (Jones) (spinicaudatan). Among these, the first local appearances of the lingulid species, ?Otoceras sp. and M. mangaliensis are associated with the palynofloral Protohaploxypinus microcorpus Zone and are interpreted as latest Changhsingian in age. Other occurrences of the Redback-2 fossil assemblage overlap with the palynofloral Kraeuselisporites saeptatus Zone and are considered to be of earliest Triassic (Griesbachian) age. G.R.

Comparing the interior, surface, and atmosphere evolution of Earth, Mars, and Venus is essential to understanding what processes determined habitability of our own planet and Earth-like planets everywhere. This is particularly true in an era where we expect thousands, and then millions, of terrestrial exoplanets to be discovered. Earth and Mars have already dedicated exploration programmes, but our understanding of Venus, particularly of its geology and its history, lags behind. Multiple exploration vehicles will be needed to characterize Venus\u2019 richly varied interior, surface, atmosphere and magnetosphere environments. Between now and 2050 we recommend that ESA launch at least two M-class missions to Venus (in order of priority): a geophysics-focussed orbiter (the currently proposed M5 EnVision orbiter \u2013 [1] \u2013 or equivalent); and an in situ atmospheric mission (such as the M3 EVE balloon mission \u2013 [2]). An in situ and orbital mission could be combined in a single L-class mission, as was argued in responses to the call for L2/L3 themes [3\u20135]. After these two missions, further priorities include a surface lander demonstrating the high-temperature technologies needed for extended surface missions; and/or a further orbiter with follow-up high-resolution surface radar imaging, and atmospheric and/or ionospheric investigations."}, {"paperId": "0bfd2b674b4acffe4cd8df455f23e5ee3fec5ddf", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bfd2b674b4acffe4cd8df455f23e5ee3fec5ddf", "title": "Evaluation of the Potential of Small Satellite Ground Station for Atmospheric Science using Near Earth Space Communications", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47735870", "name": "M.

On the other, it has underpinned scientific progress in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences as well as in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Just to recall some of the highest public profile contributions from the field, satellite measurements showed the extent of the ozone layer depletion in the atmosphere and the existence of exoplanets and black holes have been confirmed, among many other scientific advances. The rapid progress made in Space Technology led to extraordinary accomplishments for the whole human race, such as the Moon landing. At the same time, these space missions have provided powerful iconic imagery for humanity, and photos like the Blue Marble (Wuebbles, 2012) have become universally recognized symbols of our planet and its extraordinary environment and finite resources. Although the spectacular progress in Space Technologies slowed down toward the end of the past century, together with that of the whole Aerospace sector, very important achievements continued to be made. These include the development of the International Space Station and the robotic exploration of other planets and celestial bodies, including landing on a comet! Through the years, space has often been identified as the new frontier, fueling the imagination of writers and film directors, who created visions (more or less plausible) of a future enabled by fantastic developments in Space Technologies. However, consistent with what history has shown us, is the fact that, after an initial phase of \u201cexploration\u201d of a new environment and consolidation of the relevant technologies, what follows is an explosion of businesses to exploit the new opportunities offered by the new environment. This is where we are today. Sometimes called Space 4.0, we are in a period that has seen a shift of paradigms, with changes of motivations, actors, and, indeed, technologies (PWC Report, 2019)."}, {"paperId": "0c0b5536c680ef84c818e38bab61074626cc74fe", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0b5536c680ef84c818e38bab61074626cc74fe", "title": "Urban-rural interactions in a South Korean forest: uncertainties in isoprene-OH interactions limit understanding of ozone and secondary organic aerosols production", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/15/4357/2015/acp-15-4357-2015.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/ACPD-14-16691-2014?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/ACPD-14-16691-2014, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The CHRONOS space mission concept provides time-resolved abundance for emissions and transport studies of the highly variable and highly uncertain air pollutants carbon monoxide and methane, with sub-hourly revisit rate at fine (\u223c\u20094\u202fkm) horizontal spatial resolution across a North American domain. CHRONOS can provide complete synoptic air pollution maps ( snapshots ) of the continental domain with less than 10\u202fmin of observations. This rapid mapping enables visualization of air pollution transport simultaneously across the entire continent and enables a sentinel-like capability for monitoring evolving, or unanticipated, air pollution sources in multiple locations at the same time with high temporal resolution. CHRONOS uses a compact imaging gas filter correlation radiometer for these observations, with heritage from more than 17 years of scientific data and algorithm advances by the science teams for the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft in low Earth orbit. To achieve continental-scale sub-hourly sampling, the CHRONOS mission would be conducted from geostationary orbit, with the instrument hosted on a communications or meteorological platform. CHRONOS observations would contribute to an integrated observing system for atmospheric composition using surface, suborbital and satellite data with atmospheric chemistry models, as defined by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites. Addressing the U.S. National Academy's 2007 decadal survey direction to characterize diurnal changes in tropospheric composition, CHRONOS observations would find direct societal applications for air quality management and forecasting to protect public health."}, {"paperId": "0ca2cb4529634114325ae64e7ba0f557cea1c495", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ca2cb4529634114325ae64e7ba0f557cea1c495", "title": "High-power Millimeter Wave Radiation for Fundamental and Applied Plasma Studies at the A.

V I Tatarskii is world renowned and acknowledged for his fundamental contributions on the theory of wave propagation in randomly inhomogeneous media. The results of these studies have been applied to of fundamental problems of turbulence and organized structures in the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere. The asymptotic formulations obtained by V I Tatarskii are widely used to solve applied problems of long-range radio communication and radio navigation, to estimate the influence of atmospheric turbulence on laser radiation propagation and on the image of astronomical objects in telescopes, to develop methods and systems of adaptive optics, scintillometry, and acoustic and radioacoustic ground-based sensing of the atmospheric boundary layer and satellite radio occultation of Earth's and other planets' atmospheres. Valerian Il'ich Tatarskii was born in Kharkov. His father was an engineer and in the 1920s\u00b11930s took part in building many large industrial enterprises in the USSR. For this reason, the Tatarskiis often moved from one place to another (his mother was a homemaker). Valerian went to school in Kharkiv and finished with a gold medal in Krasnoyarsk, where his family was evacuated from Kharkiv at the beginning of the war, together with the plant at which his father worked. Immediately after school, Valerian entered the Physical Faculty of Moscow State University (MSU). While studying at the Physical Faculty of MSU (1947\u00b1 1952), V I Tatarskii already became interested in the influence of turbulent inhomogeneities on sound propagation. This problem underlaid his diploma work, which he did under the guidance of Professor V A Krasil'nikov. On graduating from MSU, he went to work at the Geophysical Institute of the USSRAcademy of Sciences at the Laboratory for Turbulence Research, where he continued working in this field under the guidance of A M Obukhov. V I Tatarskii significantly developed theories of sound scattering and propagation of acoustic and electromagnetic waves in random media, which were originally proposed by A M Obukhov in the 1940s\u00b1 1950s, and covered a wider range of topics. To solve these problems, V I Tatarskii modified and put to wide use the method of smooth perturbations proposed earlier by SM Rytov to solve the problem of light diffraction by ultrasound and then used by A M Obukhov to allow for diffraction in the propagation of acoustic and light waves in a turbulent medium. These results lay the basis for his candidate thesis and his monograph, ``The theory of fluctuation phenomena upon wave propagation in a turbulent atmosphere,'' published in 1959 and then abroad in English in 1961 (Tatarskii V I Wave Propagation in a Turbulent Medium (New York: McGrawHill, 1961)). Continuing his work at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, which split in 1956 from the Geophysical Institute, V I Tatarskii went on developing his approaches in the theoretical description of wave scattering and propagation in randomly inhomogeneous media using increasingly powerful mathematical methods. These approaches were reflected in his doctoral thesis (1964) and in the monograph, ``Wave propagation in a turbulent atmosphere,'' whose issue in English in 1971 (Tatarskii V I The Effects of the Turbulent Atmosphere on Wave Propagation (Springfield: National Technical Information Office, 1971)) became very popular among foreign specialists. V I Tatarskii did not confine himself to purely theoretical studies, working fruitfully with his colleagues and experimentalists, in particular with A S Gurvich.

We outlined the key science that a large UV facility would make possible and the instrumentation to be implemented.The growth of luminous structures and the building blocks of life in the Universe began as primordial gas was processed in stars and mixed at galactic scales. The mechanisms responsible for this development are not well-understood and have changed over the intervening 13 billion years. To follow the evolution of matter over cosmic time, it is necessary to study the strongest (resonance) transitions of the most abundant species in the Universe. Most of them are in the ultraviolet (UV; 950\u00a0\u00c5\u20133000\u00a0\u00c5) spectral range that is unobservable from the ground. A\u00a0versatile space observatory with UV sensitivity a factor of 50\u2013100 greater than existing facilities will revolutionize our understanding of the Universe.Habitable planets grow in protostellar discs under ultraviolet irradiation, a by-product of the star-disk interaction that drives the physical and chemical evolution of discs and young planetary systems. The electronic transitions of the most abundant molecules are pumped by this UV field, providing unique diagnostics of the planet-forming environment that cannot be accessed from the ground. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is in constant interaction with the interplanetary medium and the solar UV radiation field. A\u00a050\u2013100 times improvement in sensitivity would enable the observation of the key atmospheric ingredients of Earth-like exoplanets (carbon, oxygen, ozone), provide crucial input for models of biologically active worlds outside the solar system, and provide the phenomenological baseline to understand the Earth atmosphere in context."}, {"paperId": "0cba400e4daf470500a5e2100505134bf0f22543", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cba400e4daf470500a5e2100505134bf0f22543", "title": "Correction for Branch and Wulfmeyer, Deliberate enhancement of rainfall using desert plantations", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/40/20241.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1073/pnas.1915645116?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915645116, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The mission science objectives cover several applications related to solid earth, the cryosphere, upper-ocean dynamics and air\u2013sea interactions. The mission consists of a constellation of two satellites, flying with the Copernicus Sentinel 1 (C or D) spacecraft, each hosting a C-band receive-only radar and a thermal infrared (TIR) payload. From an ocean dynamics/air\u2013sea interaction perspective, the mission will provide the unique opportunity to observe simultaneously the signature of submesoscale upper-ocean processes via synthetic aperture radar and TIR imagery. The TIR imager is based on microbolometer technology and its acquisitions will rely on four channels: three narrow-band channels yielding observations at a \u22431 km spatial sampling distance (SSD) and a panchromatic (PAN, 8\u201312 \u03bcm) channel characterized by a \u2243300 m SSD. Our study investigates the potential of Harmony in retrieving spatial features related to sea surface temperature (SST) gradients from the high-resolution PAN channel, relying on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. Compared to a standard SST gradient retrieval, our approach does not require atmospheric correction, thus avoiding uncertainties due to inter-channel co-registration and radiometric consistency, with the possibility of exploiting the higher resolution of the PAN channel. The investigations were carried out simulating the future Harmony TOA radiances (TARs), as well as relying on existing state-of-the-art level 1 satellite products. Our approach enables the correct description of SST features at the sea surface avoiding the generation of spurious features due to atmospheric correction and/or instrumental issues. In addition, analyses based on existing satellite products suggest that the clear-sky TOA observations, in a typical mid-latitude scene, allow the reconstruction of up to 85% of the gradient magnitudes found at the sea-surface level. The methodology is less efficient in tropical areas, suffering from smoothing effects due to the high concentrations of water vapor."}, {"paperId": "0ccbbf740cd651937f2e869245645637b05d2378", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ccbbf740cd651937f2e869245645637b05d2378", "title": "Prediction of CCN number concentration using Measurements of Aerosol Size Distributions and Composition and Light Scattering Enhancement due to Humidity", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "13267728", "name": "B.

However, forecasting ENSO is one of the most difficult problems in climate sciences affecting both interannual climate prediction and decadal prediction of near-term global climate change. The key question is what cause the switch between El Nino and La Nina. For the past 30 years, ENSO forecasts have been limited to short lead times after ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly has already developed, but unable to predict the switch between El Nino and La Nina. Here, we demonstrate that the switch between El Nino and La Nina is caused by a subsurface ocean wave propagating from western Pacific to central and eastern Pacific and then triggering development of SST anomaly. This is based on analysis of all ENSO events in the past 136 years using multiple long-term observational datasets. The wave\u2019s slow phase speed and decoupling from atmosphere indicate that it is a forced wave. Further analysis of Earth\u2019s angular momentum budget and NASA\u2019s Apollo Landing Mirror Experiment suggests that the subsurface wave is likely driven by lunar tidal gravitational force."}, {"paperId": "0cdb501f134bafbde54438ff02733da7215ecc02", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cdb501f134bafbde54438ff02733da7215ecc02", "title": "NATIVE PLANTS FOR OPTIMIZING CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN RECLAIMED LANDS", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2432749", "name": "P.

More specifically, on Jetstream, Kubernetes is used for automating deployment and scaling of domain specific containerized applications, and JupyterHub is used for spawning multiple hubs within the same Kubernetes cluster instance that will be used for supporting classroom settings.

Cudennec (cudennec@agrocampus-ouest.fr)The security of Mankind is multi-faceted as it is chal-lenged by many hazards and threats, with variable expo-sures across space and time. It is now recognized that theimpacts of disasters are increasing (see, for example, WMO-No. 1123, WMO, 2014) as is their complexity in many partsof the world, resulting in the Sendai Declaration \u201cto en-hance our efforts to strengthen disaster risk reduction to re-duce losses of lives and assets from disasters worldwide\u201d(UNGA, 2015, p. 1), with an emphasis on the role of Sci-ence (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2015). Geophysical extreme eventsand geopolitical crisis have always been the two major causesof disasters and catastrophes. However, the risks are growingconsistently with the acceleration and increasing complex-ity of the Anthropocene and through the emergence of newnatural-technological interfaces and interactions, new cas-cading events and processes, severe changes in the driversand internal features of (sub) systems, changing geographicalvulnerability and resilience characteristics, and new hazardsaside from the traditional ones.The eight associations of IUGG \u2013 the International Unionof Geodesy and Geophysics \u2013 develop scienti\ufb01c knowledgeand methods concerning all geophysical processes that poserisk to society. In addition, IUGG also facilitates multidis-ciplinary approaches thanks to the richness of its commu-nities and to catalyzing mechanisms (Ismail-Zadeh et al.,2014). One of these approaches is the establishment of bridg-ing symposia during Union assemblies. At the 2015 PragueAssembly, the Union symposium U2 offered a panoramaof keynotes on \u201cIntegrated disaster risk science \u2013 Account-ing for extremes\u201d from each of the Associations and ad hoccommissions. A major follow up event was the JH1 inter-associations symposium dedicated to \u201cExtreme hydrologicalevents\u201d as water is at the interface of several compartmentsand processes studied by the different disciplines. The JH1symposium was organized in cooperation with WMO, withthis PIAHS volume being a signi\ufb01cant output.Extreme hydrological events develop at the Earth\u2019s sur-face with low frequency and high magnitude. They are oftendriven by closely connected causal forces from other aspectsof geophysics, such as meteorological, oceanographic, andseismological processes. They are often complex in terms oftheir distribution of water over time and space, its phases,and its impacts on storages. They also often develop overthe interfaces of liquid freshwater with marine, atmospheric,icy and snowy solid, and ground waters. A large in\ufb02uenceof such events also exists with human and physical geogra-phies, in terms of feedback and feedforward process interac-tions, particularly in the areas of disaster risk management,disaster mitigation and prevention.Consistent with the IAHS Panta Rhei initiative (Montanariet al., 2013) and the multi-dimensional de\ufb01nition of WaterSecurity (Cudennec et al., 2015), this volume contains con-tributions on\u2013 the assessment, measurement, understanding, mod-elling, forecasting, prediction and management of ex-treme hydrological events;\u2013 the complexity of geophysical interfaces and science-society interactions;\u2013 new direct and indirect technologies, from speci\ufb01c ob-servational techniques to modelling and statistical ap-proaches;\u2013 the challenges that these issues pose in the context ofclimatic, geographical and societal change; and\u2013 conceptual advances regarding the concepts of the An-thropocene and the dimensions of Water Security."}, {"paperId": "0d59a2277a535cad6ca0d4ce1b121faee66367a7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d59a2277a535cad6ca0d4ce1b121faee66367a7", "title": "Correction to: Remote effect of model systematic bias in tropical SST on the cold bias over the Tibetan Plateau", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00382-022-06486-9.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s00382-022-06486-9?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06486-9, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To this end, the emerging field of 3D computed cloud tomography (CCT) aims to more precisely characterize clouds by utilizing multi-dimensional imaging to reconstruct their outer and inner structure. In this paper, we propose a future Earth observation mission concept, driven by the needs of CCT, that operates constellation of NanoSats to provide multi-angular, spectrally-resolved, spatial and temporal scientific measurements of natural atmospheric phenomena. Our proposed mission, GEOSCAN, will on-board active steering capability to rapidly reconfigure networked swarm of autonomous Nanosats to track evolving phenomena of interest, on-demand, in real-time. We present the structure of the GEOSCAN constellation and discuss details of the mission concept from both science and engineering perspectives. On the science side, we out-line the types of remote Earth observation measurements that GEOSCAN enables beyond the state-of-the-art, and how such measurements translate to improvements in CCT that can lead to reduction in uncertainty of the global climate models (GCMs). From the engineering side, we investigate feasibility of the concept starting from hardware components of the NanoSat that form the basis of the constellation. In particular, we focus on the active steering capability of the GEOSCAN with algorithmic approaches that enable coordination from new software. We identify technology gaps that need to be bridged and discuss other aspects of the mission that require in-depth analysis to further mature the concept."}, {"paperId": "0da04ae691549044d20403ed762c065d1729c213", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0da04ae691549044d20403ed762c065d1729c213", "title": "CarbonTracker-Lagrange: A model-data assimilation system for North American carbon flux estimates", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087684734", "name": "Wei He"}, {"authorId": "47665967", "name": "Huilin Chen"}, {"authorId": "72923206", "name": "I.

ATLID\u2019s purpose is to provide vertical profiles of optically thin cloud and aerosol layers, as well as the altitude of cloud boundaries, with a resolution of 100 m for altitudes of 0 to 20 km, and a resolution of 500 m for 20 km to 40 km. In order to achieve this objective ATLID emits short duration laser pulses in the ultraviolet, at a repetition rate of 51 Hz, while pointing in a near nadir direction along track of the satellite trajectory. The atmospheric backscatter signal is then collected by its 620 mm aperture telescope, filtered through the optics of the instrument focal plane assembly, in order to separate and measure the atmospheric Mie and Rayleigh scattering signals. With the completion of the full instrument assembly in 2019, ATLID has been subjected to an ambient performance test campaign, followed by a successful environmental qualification test campaign, including performance calibration and characterization in thermal vacuum conditions. In this paper the design and operational principle of ATLID is recalled and the major performance test results are presented, addressing the main key receiver and emitter characteristics. Finally, the estimated instrument, in-orbit, flight predictions are presented; these indicate compliance of the ALTID instrument performance against its specification and that it will meet its mission science objectives for the EarthCARE mission, to be launched in 2023."}, {"paperId": "0dcf53a6b47e48bc66527f203ddcc43981a96875", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0dcf53a6b47e48bc66527f203ddcc43981a96875", "title": "Expedition 379 Scientific Prospectus Addendum: Amundsen Sea West Antarctic Ice Sheet History: development and sensitivity of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet tested from drill records of the Amundsen Sea Embayment", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://publications.iodp.org/scientific_prospectus/379/379SPADD/379SP_ADD.PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14379/iodp.sp.379add.2018?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14379/iodp.sp.379add.2018, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Therefore, the WAIS has likely had a very dynamic history over the last several million years. A complete collapse of the WAIS would result in a global sea level rise of 3.3\u20134.3 m, yet the world\u2019s scientific community is not able to predict its future behavior. Moreover, knowledge about past behavior of the WAIS is poor, in particular during geological times with climatic conditions similar to those expected for the near and distant future. Reconstructions and quantifications of partial or complete WAIS collapses in the past are urgently needed for constraining and testing ice sheet models that aim to predict future WAIS behavior and the potential contribution of the WAIS to global sea level rise. Large uncertainties exist regarding the chronology, extent, rates, and spatial and temporal variability of past advances and retreats of the WAIS across the continental shelves. These uncertainties largely result from the fundamental lack of data from drill cores recovered proximal to the WAIS. The continental shelf and rise of the Amundsen Sea are prime targets for drilling because the records are expected to yield archives of pure WAIS dynamics unaffected by other ice sheets and the WAIS sector draining into the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) currently experiences the largest ice loss in Antarctica (Paolo et al., 2015). We propose a series of drill sites for the ASE shelf where seismic data reveal seaward-dipping sedimentary sequences that span from the preglacial depositional phase to the most recent glacial periods. Our strategy is to drill a transect from the oldest sequences close to the bedrock/basin boundary at the middle\u2013inner shelf transition to the youngest sequences on the outer shelf in the eastern ASE. If the eastern ASE is inaccessible due to sea ice cover, a similar transect of sites can be drilled on the western ASE. The core transect will provide a detailed history of the glacial cycles in the Amundsen Sea region and allow comparison to the glacial history from the Ross Sea sector. In addition, deep-water sites on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea are selected for recovering continuous records of glacially transported sediments and detailed archives of climatic and oceanographic changes throughout glacial\u2013interglacial cycles. We will apply a broad suite of analytical techniques, including multiproxy analyses, to address our objectives of reconstructing the onset of glaciation in the greenhouse to icehouse transition, processes of dynamic ice sheet behavior during the Neogene and Quaternary, and ocean conditions associated with the glacial cycles. The five principal objectives of Expedition 379 are as follows: 1. To reconstruct the glacial history of West Antarctica from the Paleogene to recent times and the dynamic behavior of the WAIS during the Neogene and Quaternary, especially possible partial or full WAIS collapses, and the WAIS contribution to past sea level changes. Emphasis is placed in particular on studying the response of the WAIS at times when the pCO2 in Earth\u2019s atmosphere exceeded 400 ppm and atmospheric and oceanic temperatures were higher than at present. 2. To correlate the WAIS-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea with global records of ice volume changes and proxy records for air and seawater temperatures. 3. To study the relationship between incursions of warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) onto the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the stability of marine-based ice sheet margins under warm water conditions. 4. To reconstruct the processes of major WAIS advances onto the middle and outer shelf that are likely to have occurred since the middle Miocene and compare their timing and processes to those of other Antarctic continental shelves. 5. To identify the timing of the first ice sheet expansion onto the continental shelf of the ASE and its possible relationship to the uplift of Marie Byrd Land. Schedule for Expedition 379 International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 379 is based on IODP drilling Proposal 839-Full and 839-Add (available at http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/amundsen_sea_ice _sheet_history.html). Following evaluation by the IODP Science Evaluation Panel, the expedition was scheduled for the research vessel (R/V) JOIDES Resolution, operating under contract with the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO). At the time of publication of this Scientific Prospectus, the expedition is scheduled to start in Punta Arenas, Chile, on 18 January 2019 and to end in Punta Arenas, Chile, on 20 March 2019. A total of 56 days will be available for the transit, drilling, coring, and downhole measurements described in this report (for the current detailed schedule, see http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops). Further details about the facilities aboard the JOIDES Resolution can be found at http://iodp.tamu.edu/publicinfo/drillship.html. Introduction For decades, the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) drainage sector has been considered the most vulnerable part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) because of the great water depth at the grounding line and the lack of substantial ice shelves (Hughes, 1981). Glaciers in this configuration are thought to be susceptible to rapid or runaway retreat (Schoof, 2007). Recent models suggest that a threshold leading to collapse of WAIS in this sector may have been passed already (Joughin et al., 2014) and that much of the ice sheet could be lost even under relatively moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Model projections are limited by lack of constraints in several areas, most notably in a lack of detailed reconstructions about glacial history. Drilling in the ASE will provide tests of several key questions about controls on ice sheet stability. First, it will offer a direct record of glacial history in a drainage basin that receives ice just from the WAIS, allowing clear comparisons between the WAIS history and low-latitude records. Ice draining into the ASE is grounded below sea level and thus allows a test of the marine ice sheet instability through correlation of the ice history to sea level changes. Although there is currently only a very small ice shelf in front of the grounding line today, the embayment has had ice shelves during some points of its history (Kirshner et al., 2012) that will allow examination of the grounding line history relative to the ice-shelf history. Today, warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) is impinging onto the Amundsen Sea shelf, causing melting of the underside of the ice; reconstructions of past CDW intrusions (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017) will assess the ties between warm water and large-scale changes in past grounding line positions. These tests will take place in the drainage basin that currently has the largest negative mass balance of ice of anywhere in Antarctica (Paolo et al., 2015) and is thus of prime interest to future predictions. Finally, this expedition will take place as part of a suite of Antarctic IODP expeditions, al-"}, {"paperId": "0de7dd4775b354489c44d498bb00694b766b7340", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0de7dd4775b354489c44d498bb00694b766b7340", "title": "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "15336531", "name": "V.

We use a Bayesian retrieval framework to analyze how the information on the atmospheric structure extractable from MIR emission spectra of terrestrial exoplanets change with the covered wavelength range, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution (R). In combination with the science goals for the LIFE mission, these simulations will provide us with first quantitative estimates of key technical requirements needed for such a telescope.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Context</strong></p>\n<p>A long-term objective of exoplanet research is to investigate the atmospheric properties of small and rocky exoplanets. A driving force behind this effort is the potential identification of habitable worlds. This data will improve our understanding of the diversity of extra-solar planetary bodies. Currently planned space- and ground-based telescopes are unlikely to be sensitive enough to characterize a large number of such atmospheres.</p>\n<p>Future space missions (e.g. NASA's LUVOIR [a] and HabEx [b] concepts), capable of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres in reflected light (in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range), have been proposed. Complementary to these efforts, the LIFE mission proposed in Quanz et al. (2018), which is discussed in more detail in another submission to this conference by Angerhausen et al., targets the mid-infrared (MIR) thermal emission of exoplanets using a nulling interferometer. This wavelength range is of particular interest since it allows us to probe for atmospheric molecules not accessible in the optical or NIR range such as the biosignatures CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O as well as CO. Furthermore, MIR emission observations, in contrast to optical and NIR observations, are capable of accurately probing the temperature structure and the radius of exoplanets (Quanz et al. 2019). Both are hardly constrained in reflected light observations.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Methods</strong></p>\n<p>Our approach is based on the retrieval of simulated mock observations of Earth-twin exoplanets around solar-type stars. We generate the emission spectrum of an Earth twin using the 1D radiative transfer tool petitRADTRANS (Molli&#232;re et al., 2019). The model takes the surface gravity, the pressure-temperature (PT) profile and the atmospheric gas composition as input. We parametrize the standard Earth&#8217;s PT profile with a 4th order polynomial and consider the line Absorption from H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CO as well as collision-induced absorption from N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n<p>Then, we use the LifeSIM (Ottiger et al. in prep.) tool to estimate the wavelength-dependent SNR expected for observations with a LIFE-like telescope, considering noise sources from stellar leakage, local zodiacal dust, and exozodiacal dust. We consider an Earth twin located at a distance of 10 pc from the Sun around a G2 star with 3 exozodis. We generate mock observations for the following grid of wavelength ranges, Rs and SNRs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Range = 3-20 &#956;m, 6-17 &#956;m</li>\n<li>R = 20, 35, 50&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>\n<li>SNR = 5, 10, 15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our retrieval mechanism is built upon the Multinest algorithm (Feroz et al., 2009). Given the Earth twin input spectrum and treating the LifeSIM noise as uncertainty on the spectrum, we retrieve the PT profile, the mass, the radius, the surface pressure as well as the abundances of the different atmospheric species. Performing a retrieval study of the spectra taking into account all possible combinations of the specified ranges in wavelength, R and SNR, provides first estimates for the technical requirements we need to meet to characterize Earth-like atmospheres.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Results</strong></p>\n<p>A preliminary result, and a proof of concept from testing of our retrieval framework, is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The input for the retrieval is an Earth-twin spectrum (range = 3 - 25 &#956;m, R = 1000, SNR = 50) seen at&#160; a distance of 10 pc from the Sun. Please note that for the results given below, only the planet&#8217;s photon noise was considered and not yet additional noise sources.&#160;</p>\n<p>Figure 1 shows that the PT profile parameters, as well as the surface temperature, are accurately retrieved by our retrieval suite. Figure 2 gives the retrieved posteriors for the planet&#8217;s radius, mass and atmospheric abundances. The histogram in the top-right corner indicates the retrieved absolute abundance of CO<sub>2</sub>. We give all other abundances relative to the CO<sub>2</sub> abundance. Additionally, our retrieval framework constrains the planet's radius with high fidelity.&#160;</p>\n<p>These first results demonstrate that our retrieval suite provides reliable results. In-depth analyses of the results for the grid mentioned above are currently ongoing and will be presented at the conference. In addition, a comparison with literature results from simulations of reflected light observations will be discussed.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,

In this report brief discussions of three mechanisms that attenuate millimeter waves in the atmosphere are presented: rain attenuation, clear air absorption, and atmospheric multipath. Propagation models developed by personnel at the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences and by others were combined with meteorological statistics to obtain estimates of average year attenuation distributions for 18 cities in the United States. The estimates are presented in such a way to elucidate the restrictions on system parameters required for reliable operation, i.e. frequency, path length for terrestrial paths, and path elevation angle for earth\u2013satellite paths. The variation imposed by the diverse climates within the United States is demonstrated. Generally, in regions that have humid climates, millimeter wave systems perform less favorably than in areas where arid or semi\u2013arid conditions prevail."}, {"paperId": "0ef9efccbdef7dcf23855c18a38ba7159c120841", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ef9efccbdef7dcf23855c18a38ba7159c120841", "title": "Present State of Knowledge of the Upper Atmosphere 1996: An Assessment Report to Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5182290", "name": "M.

The results of measurementsof specific meteorological elements and the concentration of contaminants come from themeteorological station of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences in the years 2014-2019. Theanalysis of correlation and the MLP model path were used to carry out the analysis. The obtainedresults and relationships show that there is an influence of air contaminant concentrations onthe intensity of solar radiation and insolation. High variability of the given parameters was alsorevealed, depending on the range of horizontal visibility as well as relative air humidity. The valueof the correlation coefficient r=0.80 and comparison of the intensity of measured and predictedsolar radiation of the analysed parameters make it possible to claim that the developed MLP modelfacilitates good prediction of the intensity of solar radiation based on the implemented inputdata. The analysis of the sensitivity of the model revealed that the air temperature has the greatestinfluence on the value of solar radiation intensity, and as far as air contaminants are concerned, theconcentration of particulate matter PM10 has a greatest influence on lowering its value."}, {"paperId": "0f5f13c31bce2d8bd506c4e49f0b2dd06dc9ea7c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f5f13c31bce2d8bd506c4e49f0b2dd06dc9ea7c", "title": "Could the Recent Taal Volcano Eruption Trigger an El Ni\u00f1o and Lead to Eurasian Warming?", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00376-020-2041-z.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The mitigation of the risks related to this legacy Hg was a reason to implement the Minamata Convention. Subsequent work under the convention is dependent on assessments of the Hg stored in the environment. A way of doing this is to study environmental archives of atmospheric deposition such as ice cores, lake sediments, and peatlands. A previous study along a chronosequence of mires along the northern coast of Sweden showed Hg content differing by a factor of 2 and correlating strongly with mire age. This was hypothesized to indicate that differences in minerogenic water supply along the chronosequence influenced the stability of Hg after deposition from the atmosphere to the mire surface. Declining access of minerogenic elements with increasing peatland age results in a less nutrient demanding plant species composition as well as decreasing access to microbial electron acceptors. But that study looked at just one 10 cm layer at a depth with peat ca 50 years old. Here we present a more rigorous test of that hypothesis by presenting the total amount and vertical pattern of Hg accumulation during the last 200 years in the superficial peat along that peatland chronosequence.</p><p>Eleven peatlands along the northern coast of Sweden near Ume&#229; were sampled. This is an area where isostatic rebound continues to raise the land above the sea level. Triplicate peat cores were collected from both lawns and hummocks, when present. A total of 54 peat cores, each 50 cm deep, were collected and frozen immediately. The cores were then sliced into 2 cm layers, and each slice was analysed for total Hg. Due to the land rising out of the sea, the different peatlands have ages ranging from 100-2000 years since establishment, despite being located within a distance of <10 km. The peatland age correlates with availability of mineral elements and pH. This is due to the fact that the underlying postglacial mineral soil is a source of elements. The distance to the mineral soil increases as peat accumulates with peatland age. Certain elements also leach from the peatlands over time. This documentation of the vertical distribution of Hg in all the peat laid down during the past 200 years in each mire tests the hypothesis that the propensity of Hg to evade back to the atmosphere in this area is related to the amount and composition of inorganic elements.</p>\n"}, {"paperId": "0f64387a427b94176dbb7bfb078b4478dcb6eeeb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f64387a427b94176dbb7bfb078b4478dcb6eeeb", "title": "Celebrating the twentieth anniversary of EFM", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10652-020-09773-3.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The experiment uses solar occultation to measure vertical profiles of O3, HCl, HF, CH4, H2O, NO, NO2, aerosol extinction, and temperature versus pressure with an instantaneous vertical field of view of 1.6 km at the Earth limb. Latitudinal coverage is from 80\u00b0S to 80\u00b0N over the course of 1 year and includes extensive observations of the Antarctic region during spring. The altitude range of the measurements extends from about 15 km to \u2248 60\u2013130 km, depending on channel. Experiment operations have been essentially flawless, and all performance criteria either meet or exceed specifications. Internal data consistency checks, comparisons with correlative measurements, and qualitative comparisons with 1985 atmospheric trace molecule spectroscopy (ATMOS) results are in good agreement. Examples of pressure versus latitude cross sections and a global orthographic projection for the September 21 to October 15, 1992, period show the utility of CH4, HF, and H2O as tracers, the occurrence of dehydration in the Antarctic lower stratosphere, the presence of the water vapor hygropause in the tropics, evidence of Antarctic air in the tropics, the influence of Hadley tropical upwelling, and the first global distribution of HCl, HF, and NO throughout the stratosphere.

While JODA covers a range of fossiliferous Cenozoic rock, most paleontological fieldwork conducted by the park staff occurs in the highly fossiliferous Oligocene Turtle Cove Member of the John Day Formation. To optimize the number of fossils collected, JODA established a schedule that cycled fieldwork every four years between the five most fossiliferous areas of the park. We digitized over 1000 field collections from 19992019 to evaluate whether the four-year return interval allowed enough time for new fossils to be exposed through erosion in an area between visits as intended by the schedule. We found no significant difference in fossil yield between areas that had not been visited for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5+ years. Based on these results, we infer that the claystones of the Turtle Cove Member are erodible and fossiliferous enough that one winter of erosion will expose enough fossils to fully \u201crecharge\u201d an area that had been thoroughly inventoried the previous year. Because of limited staff and high fossil yield, not every fossil will be collected. Therefore, we use this analysis to shift JODA\u2019s paleontological inventory and monitoring practices away from a rigid schedule and propose a flexible new system. The paleontology staff will use a tracker geodatabase of locality data from past years to set priorities each year based on past collection and current available staff and space. Anne E. Kort.

The mirrors typical to current space telescopes are replaced by MODE lenses with a 10 times lighter areal density that are 100 times less sensitive to misalignments, enabling lightweight structure. MODE lenses can be cost-effectively replicated through molding. The Nautilus mission concept has a potential to greatly reduce fabrication and launch costs and mission risks compared to the current space telescope paradigm through replicated components and identical, lightweight unit telescopes. Nautilus is designed to survey transiting exo-earths for biosignatures up to a distance of 300 pc, enabling a rigorous statistical exploration of the frequency and properties of life-bearing planets and the diversity of exo-earths."}, {"paperId": "0fcc592ec36279835ce210990fabc38d43a50a53", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fcc592ec36279835ce210990fabc38d43a50a53", "title": "Painting Science in Helsinki", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-16140?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-16140, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Maslin"}], "abstract": "When one of the richest men in the world writes a book, people usually take notice. When it is Bill Gates a leader of the tech revolution and it is about climate change, then it becomes a phenomenon. So why has Bill Gates become passionate about climate change and now sees it as the greatest threat to humanity? It all starts with his work with his wife Melinda at the Gates Foundation which was originally focused on global health, development and US education. Two important facts emerged from the funded work of the Gates Foundation. First was that global health and development were being held back by a lack of access to affordable energy: 860 million people still have no access to electricity\u2014which raises the question how to produce this electricity. Second was that all the improvements in global health could be wiped out by climate change\u2014which will increase both food and water insecurity for billions of people. So, Bill Gates went on a journey of discovery and like all super-nerds wanted to find the most efficient technological solutions to the climate crisis. It is important to remember that this book is not just rhetoric: Bill Gates is putting his money where his mouth is, both through his Foundation and the company he founded, Microsoft. For the great monolithic global corporation, Microsoft is following his lead and taking climate change seriously. In 2020, the company announced the ambitious target to go carbon negative by 2030. Even more ambitiously, it has pledged to remove all the carbon pollution from the atmosphere that they and their supply chain have emitted since the founding of the company in 1975 by 2050. But here is the issue; their current plan to reach these targets is to reduce their emissions as much as possible, but then to discount the rest of their emissions by using carbon offsets or credits. Basically, Microsoft will pay others to use renewable electricity, plant trees or biofuels, restore nature or capture carbon dioxide directly from power stations or the atmosphere and dump it deep in the Earth. Many NGO and academics are highly critical of carbon offsets as it does not solve the fundamental issue of producing the emissions in the first place and allows companies to buy their way out of their environmental responsibilities. Bill Gates\u2019s book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, clearly follows the zeitgeist and is based on the fundamental principle that the world must get to net zero carbon emission by 2050 or earlier if possible. In fact, there is a whole chapter call \u201cWhy Zero\u201d. This principle needs some unpacking. Net zero carbon emissions means that there will be no increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide by 2050\u2014and if there are any emissions, these must be balanced by carbon dioxide being sucked out of the atmosphere either by technology or by planting vast forests, hence the term \u2018net\u2019. What Bill Gates glosses over is that even if we reach net zero carbon by 2050, the science clearly shows we must have negative emissions for the rest of the century if we are to have any hope of keeping global temperatures below the 2 \u00b0C limit set by world leaders in Paris in 2015. To try to make the net zero carbon target understandable, Bill Gates refers to the current 51 billion tons of carbon emitted per year as a way of illustrating all the things we need to do to reduce this huge number and eventually hit zero. Chapter 4 addresses 27% of the 51 billion tons and is about our production and use of electricity: it examines how we can decarbonise electricity production and accelerate the uptake of renewables. Chapter 5 covers 31% and mainly focuses on the production of concrete which if it were a country it would the 6th largest emitter in the world. Chapter 6 represents 19% and concerns itself with agriculture and deforestation: it explores how we can produce food more efficiently, with less environmental destruction and greenhouse gas emissions. Chapter 7 analyses howwe transport ourselves and our goods around the world which makes up 16% of the total tons of carbon"}, {"paperId": "103964c59f2253525c4602b77864f91af4597cf5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/103964c59f2253525c4602b77864f91af4597cf5", "title": "EFFECTS OF DATA ASSIMILATION OF ICE MOTION IN A BASIN-SCALE SEA ICE MODEL", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51891116", "name": "T.

A particular focus of this study is devoted to quantifying and comparing the impact on retrieval performance resulting from novel spectral bands of the microwave thermal spectrum, by means of data addition and data denial trade studies. Various spectral configurations are assessed, each reflecting specific technology solutions intended to maximize geophysical product performance within feasible size, weight, power, and cost constraints. Our results indicate that the use of a hyperspectral sampling in the oxygen and water vapor sounding lines alone provides significant improvements in the lower and free tropospheric thermodynamic fields (up to $\\sim$40%), when compared against the program of record (i.e., the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder, ATMS). Our experiments also demonstrate the essential role played by extending the coverage in the window regions, leading to an overall improvement of up to $\\sim$50% in the Earth's planetary boundary layer thermodynamic fields. This work concludes with an overview on the state of the art in hyperspectral microwave technology and a discussion on future applications of interest to numerical weather prediction and climate science.

Both approaches work fine when the telluric lines are resolved, i.e., at a spectral resolving power larger than about 10,000, and it is sufficient to facilitate the detection of spectral features at lower resolution. However, a meaningful quantitative analysis also requires the reliable recovery of line strengths. Here, we show for the Fraunhofer A-band of molecular O2 that the standard telluric correction approach fails in this at lower spectral resolutions, as an example for the general problem. Doppler-shift-dependent errors of the restored flux may arise, which can amount to more than 50% in extreme cases, depending on the line shapes of the target spectral features. Two applications are discussed: the recovery of the O2 band in the reflected light of an Earth analog atmosphere, as facilitated potentially in the future using an orbiting starshade and a ground-based extremely large telescope; and the recovery of the intrinsic ratio of the K i lines in the post-nova V4332 Sgr tracing the optical depth of the emitting region, to exemplify the relevance using present-day instrumentation. We show how one should derive correction functions for the compensation of the error in dependence of radial velocity shift, spectral resolution, and target line-profile function by use of high-resolution atmospheric transmission modeling, which has to be solved for the individual case."}, {"paperId": "1052af5697a23e0e95cdfcce1b9cc2871e1a1074", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1052af5697a23e0e95cdfcce1b9cc2871e1a1074", "title": "Radiative Transfer Modeling of the Empirical 'Volcano Scan' Atmospheric Correction: Discussion of Artifacts", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31063433", "name": "S.

During absorption, the crystal lattices of the rocks were deformed with a change in their size and shape, and the molecules of the rocks and gases formed stable chemical compounds - solid solutions [1-3]. Practice shows that under normal conditions, the reverse process - the degassing of rocks, stretches for thousands of years, which allows the crystal lattices without plastic fracture to change their sizes and shapes. But, as practice shows, at some random moment, it is possible to start the process of avalanche-like degassing of a block of rocks. After a sudden outflow of gases, the crystal lattices of the rocks must take on a natural configuration, but due to the high rate of deformation, the relaxation process cannot keep up with the increase in stress. There is a collapse of the crystal lattices with the release of energy expended by nature on their deformation and the occurrence of elastic impacts - impulses, which are known in mining practice as rock bump and sudden outburst of rocks and gas. This process is possible in the event of a chain chemical reaction in a rock mass triggered by high-energy molecules, ions, and free radicals, similar to the so-called Cold Explosion process, which was discovered in 1980 at the Institute of Chemical Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The reaction mechanism of the Cold Explosion is explained by the appearance of giant deformation loads in the sample arising from the rapid cooling of the sample. During the collapse, the process of high-speed degassing plays the role of cooling, and the mechanism of the chain chemical reaction is explained by the interaction of free radicals, high-energy molecules, and other charged particles in accordance with N. Bohr's postulates.

It is important that these two goals are linked by quantifying what precision of mass constraint is required to yield robust atmospheric properties of planets. Here, we address this by conducting retrievals on simulated James Webb Space Telescope transmission spectra under various assumptions for the degree of uncertainty in the planets mass for a representative population of seven planets ranging from terrestrials to warm Neptunes to hot Jupiters. Only for the cloud-free, low-metallicity gas giants are we able to infer exoplanet mass from transmission spectroscopy alone, to \u223c10% accuracy. For low-metallicity cases (<4\u00d7 solar) we are able to accurately constrain atmospheric properties without prior knowledge of the planet\u2019s mass. For all other cases (including terrestrial-like planets), atmospheric properties can only be inferred with a mass precision of better than \u00b150%. At this level, though, the widths of the posterior distributions of the atmospheric properties are dominated by the uncertainties in mass. With a precision of \u00b120%, the widths of the posterior distributions are dominated by the spectroscopic data quality. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, we recommend a \u00b150% mass precision for initial atmospheric characterization and a \u00b120% mass precision for more detailed atmospheric analyses."}, {"paperId": "10a78af9db6c343a368c314ca2a60db2f94f12fe", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10a78af9db6c343a368c314ca2a60db2f94f12fe", "title": "AIR COMPONENT FOREIGN BROADENING CONTRIBUTIONS TO CARBON DIOXIDE COLLISIONAL LINE SHAPES IN THE (30012) \u2190 (00001) BAND", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/2142/107346/1/4409.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15278/isms.2020.ff05?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15278/isms.2020.ff05, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A report on the science and feasibility of such a mission was recently submitted to NASA as a probe study concept. The driving objective of the concept is to determine whether Earth-like exoplanets exist in the HZs of the nearest sunlike stars and have biosignature gases in their atmospheres. With the sensitivity provided by this telescope, it is possible to measure the brightness of zodiacal dust disks around the nearest sunlike stars and establish how their population compares with our own. In addition, known gas-giant exoplanets can be targeted to measure their atmospheric metallicity and thereby determine if the correlation with planet mass follows the trend observed in the Solar System and hinted at by exoplanet transit spectroscopy data. We provide the details of the calculations used to estimate the sensitivity of Roman with a starshade and describe the publicly available Python-based source code used to make these calculations. Given the fixed capability of Roman and the constrained observing windows inherent for the starshade, we calculate the sensitivity of the combined observatory to detect these three types of targets, and we present an overall observing strategy that enables us to achieve these objectives."}, {"paperId": "10bc9230130a5cb52a1fd9614754d9615b0b2a26", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10bc9230130a5cb52a1fd9614754d9615b0b2a26", "title": "The content and stable isotopic composition of carbon in spherical micrometeorites", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2052571341", "name": "P.

These magmas, belonging to the calc-alkaline series, are more oxidised than magmatic rocks formed in other tectonic settings. Calc-alkaline rocks are largely confined to the post-Archaean world with the implication that modern-style plate tectonics is also a post-Archaean phenomenon despite a number of studies suggesting that plate tectonics and subduction possibly started in the Archaen. Nonetheless, the post-Archaean period doubtlessly fostered an oxygenated atmosphere, initially during the c.2.4 Ga Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) and subsequently during the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE), which led inexorably to the Cambrian explosion of life. Key outstanding issues though are the relationship between the Archaean-Proterozoic transition, the changing style of magmas, the rise of atmospheric oxygen, the development of a more oxidised mantle and the development of subduction-driven plate tectonics. The difficulty in resolving this debate lies in the lack of an effective proxy for determining the oxygen fugacity of suitable magmatic rocks. We have used a new approach to address this question via a recently developed synchrotron-based proxy for determining relative magma oxidation state by \u00b5-XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) analysis of S valence within the mineral apatite. We have applied this approach to apatite grains and apatite inclusions in zircon from a collection of well-constrained samples of granitoids that range in age from the Archaean"}, {"paperId": "11194af1dc6e4299d02b650159d5c6e5c5862518", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11194af1dc6e4299d02b650159d5c6e5c5862518", "title": "Photosynthesis ( NPP , NEP , Respiration )", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)\ninstrument has been operational on the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite since\nearly 2000, creating an extensive data set of global Earth observations.\nHere we introduce the latest version of the MISR aerosol products. The level\n2 (swath) product, which is reported on a 4.4\u2009km spatial grid, is designated as version 23 (V23) and contains retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and\naerosol particle property information derived from MISR's multi-angle\nobservations over both land and water. The changes from the previous version\nof the algorithm (V22) have significant impacts on the data product and its\ninterpretation. The V23 data set is created from two separate retrieval\nalgorithms that are applied over dark water and land surfaces, respectively.\nBesides increasing the horizontal resolution to 4.4\u2009km compared with the\ncoarser 17.6\u2009m resolution in V22 and streamlining the format and content,\nthe V23 product has added geolocation information, pixel-level uncertainty\nestimates, and improved cloud screening. MISR data can be obtained from the\nNASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Science Data Center at https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/misr_table (last access: 11 October 2019). The\nversion number for the V23 level 2 aerosol product is F13_0023.

Stable oxygen isotopes palaeoaltimetry is one of the most popular techniques nowadays , and relies on the difference between \u03b4 18 O of palaeo-precipitation reconstructed using the natural archives, and modern measured values for the point of interest. Our goal is to understand where and how complex climatic changes linked with the growth of mountains affect \u03b4 18 O in precipitation. For this purpose, we develop a theoretical expression for the precipitation composition based on the Rayleigh distillation and the isotope-equipped atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ-iso outputs. Experiments with reduced height over the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas have been designed. Our results show that the isotopic composition of precipitation is very sensitive to climate changes related to the growth of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau. Specifically our simulations suggest that only 40 % of sampled sites for palaeoaltimetry depict a full topographic signal, and that uplift-related changes in relative humidity (northern region) and precipitation amount (southern region) could explain absolute deviations of up to 2.5 \u2030 of the isotopic signal , thereby creating biases in palaeoelevation reconstructions ."}, {"paperId": "1137d04318aa595d1df995fb68328b827506ed6e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1137d04318aa595d1df995fb68328b827506ed6e", "title": "2001 Mars Odyssey Mission Summary", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In the words of the organizer of this symposium, Mr. S. Fred Singer, the purposes \"were to discuss the worldwide effects which may arise from local pollution and to try to uncover, if possible, hitherto unsuspected effects which might have serious consequence.\" The symposium papers have been augmented here by some additional invited papers and by introductions to each set of papers. The book is not as comprehensive as the title suggests; many aspects of environmental pollution are not discussed, e.g., thermal pollution of air and water from the conversion of energy by the combustion of fossil fuels. Information about environmental pollution is divided into four parts: 1) chemical balance of gases in the earth's atmosphere 2) nitrogen compounds in soil, water, atmosphere and precipitation 3) effects of atmospheric pollution on climate and 4) worldwide ocean pollution by toxic wastes. It is apparent from this classification that the primary focus of these papers is the atmospheric sciences. The discussions of the balance of oxygen and of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere are particularly well done. This book should interest all students of human ecology as it provides much factual material about some of the present problems of environmental pollution. Although much of the material presented is very technical, the papers are easy to read and to understand, but those who are looking for proposed solutions to current pollution problems may be disappointed in the book because such proposals are lacking. This is a book that should find its way into the library of all scientists. It is well written and the brief concluding chapter entitled \"Some Unsolved Problems: A Panel Discussion\" is particularly provocative. ERIC W.

These experiments with arm lengths of 3 to 40 m developed into schemes to build large gravitational wave observatories in several countries. At the same time the ideas for carrying out such interferometer experiments in space began to be developed. A space experiment offers the possibility of escaping from the low frequency background noise that is present on Earth due to seismic and atmospheric processes. It also offers the possibility of a very long path length which relaxes the requirements on position measurement noise. A space experiment thus opens up the possibility of searching for signals at high strain sensitivity, <10-30 Hz-1/2, in the low frequency range of 10-4 - 1 Hz. It is thought that this range will contain sources that will be detected with certainty and at a high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling gravitational theory to be tested in the strong gravitational fields that surround compact objects as well as providing astrophysical data on the sources themselves. In 1992 the ESA's science programme commenced a study of the Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP). This heralded an upsurge of interest in fundamental physics in ESA programmes which was strengthened by a proposal for LISA in 1993. After a number of assessment studies, LISA was included in 1995 as a cornerstone mission in ESA's Horizons 2000 programme. The purpose of the First International LISA Symposium was to discuss the LISA mission and the astrophysical observations which it can make together with the relevant gravitational theory. Included in the programme were papers on the technology needed for LISA and also reports on recent progress and developments in ground based detectors of gravitational radiation. Following the launch failure of ESA's cluster mission in June 1996 pressures on the Horizons 2000 programme have increased which may result in cornerstone missions such as LISA being delayed. It is unlikely that the high-frequency instruments being built on Earth will address to a significant degree the astrophysics and gravitational theory which will be studied with LISA. So it is important that every effort is made to launch LISA and thus open the low frequency window for gravitational radiation as soon as possible. A new study of LISA is in progress which takes advantage of new technology to reduce the number and cost of the space craft and this will be dealt with fully at the second International LISA Symposium which will be held in Hannover, 5 - 9 October 1998. This special issue contains the papers from the 1996 Symposium that were submitted for publication. The papers have been refereed in accordance with the policy of the Classical and Quantum Gravity editorial board. The Symposium was organised by the Space Science department at CLRC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

Some of these activities may present a risk of killing millions or even destroying the planet. Current law leaves it to agencies to decide for themselves whether their activities fall within the bounds of acceptable risk. This Article explores to what extent and under what circumstances the law ought to allow private actions against such non-regulatory agency endeavors. Engaging with this issue is not only interesting in its own right, it allows us to test fundamental concepts of agency competence and the role of the courts. \nTwo case studies provide a foundation for discussion: NASA's use of plutonium power supplies on spacecraft, which critics say could cause millions of cancers in the event of atmospheric disintegration, and a Department of Energy particle-collider experiment (the RHIC, or Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) that allegedly poses a small risk of collapsing the Earth (via a \"killer strangelet\"). These extreme examples serve as a test-bed for applying insights from neoclassical economics, behavioral economics, risk-management studies, and cognitive psychology. The resulting analysis suggests that in low-probability/high-harm scenarios, agencies are likely to do a poor job of judging the acceptability of risk to the public. Instead, generalist judges working in a common-law vein may have surprising advantages. This in turns suggests that under certain circumstances the government should be subject to legal action that provides non-deferential review of discretionary agency actions that are non-regulatory in nature."}, {"paperId": "11a5085b17ac0ead4581beccd8f552a430727e76", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11a5085b17ac0ead4581beccd8f552a430727e76", "title": "Chicxulub and Climate: Investigating the Climate Sensitivity to Stratospheric Injections of Impact-generated S-bearing Gases", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268107", "name": "E.

Nowadays, primitive life-like system is mostly considered to have emerged by chemical evolution on the Earth although some scientists are evaluating the possibility of panspermia hypothesis [1-3]. External and internal energies from the earth, such as cosmic rays, ultra violet radiation, meteorite impacts, volcanic eruption, submarine hydrothermal vent system, etc. resulted in organic molecules from inorganic materials, such as primitive atmospheric gas, minerals, materials solved in the ocean. Organic molecules were polymerized and finally resulted in several biological functions. Complex mixtures of the organic molecules should have evolved to primitive life-like systems.

Although humans have used the oceans for millennia, technological developments now allow exploitation of fisheries resources, hydrocarbons and minerals below 2000 m depth. The remoteness of the deep seafloor has promoted the disposal of residues and litter. Ocean acidification and climate change now bring a new dimension of global effects. Thus the challenges facing the deep sea are large and accelerating, providing a new imperative for the science community, industry and national and international organizations to work together to develop successful exploitation management and conservation of the deep-sea ecosystem. This paper provides scientific expert judgement and a semi-quantitative analysis of past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on global deep-sea habitats within three categories: disposal, exploitation and climate change. The analysis is the result of a Census of Marine Life \u2013 SYNDEEP workshop (September 2008). A detailed review of known impacts and their effects is provided. The analysis shows how, in recent decades, the most significant anthropogenic activities that affect the deep sea have evolved from mainly disposal (past) to exploitation (present). We predict that from now and into the future, increases in atmospheric CO2 and facets and consequences of climate change will have the most impact on deep-sea habitats and their fauna. Synergies between different anthropogenic pressures and associated effects are discussed, indicating that most synergies are related to increased atmospheric CO2 and climate change effects. We identify deep-sea ecosystems we believe are at higher risk from human impacts in the near future: benthic communities on sedimentary upper slopes, cold-water corals, canyon benthic communities and seamount pelagic and benthic communities. We finalise this review with a short discussion on protection and management methods."}, {"paperId": "120cfef05516ce422a7764496465deeaf9ca5535", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/120cfef05516ce422a7764496465deeaf9ca5535", "title": "Atmospheric science looks to Venus", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Bhat"}], "abstract": "The South Asian summer monsoon provides 80% of annual precipitation to over a billion people. Among other users of water resources, the monsoon is particularly important for agriculture and power generation, itself in support of food security and employment. Accurate prediction of the amount and timing of monsoon rainfall is vital to society across many time-scales, from daily weather forecasting up to multi-decadal changes in the mean state. While much research continues into monsoon modelling and prediction, large model biases prevail. A key opportunity lies in better measurement and understanding of processes operating at small space and time scales, particularly interactions between the surface, boundary layer and cloud dynamics which profoundly influence monsoon convection. These processes are often parametrized in models. It is against this background that the Earth System Science Organization (ESSO) of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Govt. India, in collaboration with the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), United Kingdom, funded the Drivers of variability in the South Asian monsoon programme. For NERC, this was part of a larger NERC action on \u201cDrivers of variability in atmospheric circulation\u201d, while for ESSO-MoES, this activity fell under its Monsoon Mission to improve prediction of the monsoon on short-range to interannual time-scales. This funding avenue provided the unique opportunity for the Indo-UK scientific community to collaborate on a joint observational mission to India (described in Turner et al., 2020), including the first deployment of a foreign atmospheric research aircraft to the country. The INCOMPASS aircraft mission, from bases in Lucknow and Bengaluru, took place between May and July 2016 using the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 aircraft, run jointly by NERC and the Met Office. This is a four-engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a large suite of instruments and up to 19 scientists on missions lasting up to 5 hours. Use of the aircraft was shared with the sister project SWAAMI (South West Asian Aerosol\u2013Monsoon Interactions: see, for example, Brooks et al., 2019). As described in the lead article of this Special Collection (Turner et al., 2020), the INCOMPASS field campaign is designed to better understand how an air parcel is modified as it travels towards India, crossing coastlines, mountains and a variety of land surface types and soil moisture patterns. Work motivated by INCOMPASS and published in this Special Collection has already suggested a new paradigm for the monsoon onset (Parker et al., 2016), as a tug-of-war between advancing tropical flow and a retreating dry intrusion emanating northwest of India. The erosion of this dry intrusion has been shown in modelling work to be aided by the detrainment of moisture from shallow convection (Menon et al., 2018), while the role of the extratropics has been further highlighted (Volont\u00e9 et al., 2020), showing that monsoon progression is a jerky process. While other monsoon processes such as ocean\u2013 atmosphere interaction have been heavily studied in the past, the role of the land surface is often overlooked. In particular, how the land surface feeds back on the progression of the monsoon through its seasonal cycle, or"}, {"paperId": "1239342d26bf7fe4418827b2f67ef3bbeab8a9ac", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1239342d26bf7fe4418827b2f67ef3bbeab8a9ac", "title": "Inner Workings: A new crop of landers and rovers seeks to answer key questions about Venus\u2014and, by extension, Earth", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/4525.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Laboratory prototyping and demonstration are the logical first steps in bringing these new technologies along a path to infusion in a flight mission, but it is often the case that some form of in-space validation is needed to prove out all relevant elements of a new observing system in an operational context. CubeSats and SmallSats, coupled with relatively low-cost launch options now available on rideshares, are facilitating this validation in multiple ways. Here we discuss two validation efforts for two NASA earth observing projects that are in two very different phases of mission implementation: TROPICS, an earth venture mission now in its operational phase, and CREWSR, an instrument prototyping project funded by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) Instrument Incubator Program (IIP). TROPICS was preceded by multiple in-space validation missions (most recently the Pathfinder mission), and CREWSR is now proceeding successfully along a path to be ready for a future in-space validation mission. In this paper, we provide some experiences, conclusions, and lessons learned from each of these two efforts along their project lifecycles."}, {"paperId": "124a0e6f748e670919f8ca0a864ff8d37b414798", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/124a0e6f748e670919f8ca0a864ff8d37b414798", "title": "Dissociation temperatures of methane hydrates at high pressure: Implications for the differentiation of Titan's interior", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "12021992", "name": "L.

Our model correctly accounts for the non-linear path of the light inside the atmosphere (in Earth's case), the light absorption effects by molecules and dust particles, such as the ozone layer and the Martian dust, and a wavelength-dependent phase function for Mie scattering. The mode focuses on interactivity, versatility, and customization, and a comprehensive set of interactive controls make it possible to adapt its appearance dynamically. We demonstrate our results using Earth and Mars as examples. However, it can be readily adapted for the exploration of other atmospheres found on, for example, of exoplanets. For Earth's atmosphere, we visually compare our results with pictures taken from the International Space Station and against the CIE clear sky model. The Martian atmosphere is reproduced based on available scientific data, feedback from domain experts, and is compared to images taken by the Curiosity rover.

Precession and nutation components are part of the transformation matrix between terrestrial and celestial systems. Therefore, various applications in geodetic science such as high-precision spacecraft navigation require information regrading precession and nutation. For this purpose, CPO can be added to the precession-nutation model to precisely describe the motion of the celestial pole. However, as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) \u2013 currently the only technique providing CPO \u2013 requires long data processing times resulting in several weeks of latency, predictions of CPO become necessary. Here we present a new methodology named Deep Ensemble Geophysics-Informed Neural Networks (DEGINNs) to provide accurate CPO predictions. The methodology has three main elements: (1) deep ensemble learning to provide the prediction uncertainty; (2) broad-band Liouville equation\u00a0as a geophysical constraint connecting the rotational dynamics of CPO to the atmospheric and oceanic Effective Angular Momentum functions (EAM); and (3) coupled oscillatory recurrent neural networks to model the sequential characteristics of CPO time series, also capable of handling irregularly-sampled time series. To test the methodology, we use the newest version of the final CPO time series of International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), namely IERS 20 C04. We focus on a forecasting horizon of 90\u00a0days, the practical forecasting horizon needed in space-geodetic applications. Furthermore, for validation purposes we generate an independent global VLBI solution for CPO since 1984 up to the end of 2022 and analyze the series. We draw the following conclusions. First, the prediction performance of DEGINNs demonstrates up to 25% and 33% improvement respectively for dX and dY, with respect to the rapid data provided by IERS. Second, predictions made with the help of EAM are more accurate compared to those without EAM, thus providing a clue to the role of atmosphere and ocean on the excitation of CPO. Finally, free core nutation period shows temporal variations with a dominant periodicity of around one year, partially excited by EAM."}, {"paperId": "12a236eec327f9fce0c4ecabd5515f8a1f1e8ede", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12a236eec327f9fce0c4ecabd5515f8a1f1e8ede", "title": "Impact Melt Volume Estimates of Small- to Medium-Sized Lunar Craters from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Data", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4314858", "name": "E.

The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite provides measurements of O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, formaldehyde (HCHO), aerosols, and cloud in ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral ranges. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the Aura mission measures ozone, aerosols, clouds, surface UV irradiance, and trace gases including NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, HCHO, BrO, and OClO using UV electromagnetic spectrum bands. The Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) on the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP or SNPP) provides environmental data products including O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2, </sub>and aerosols. The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Aura has been monitoring atmospheric chemical species (CO, volcanic SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, BrO), temperature, humidity, and cloud ice since 2004.<!-- MLS measures more than the species indicated here.

The Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation - Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) on the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) covers a wide spectral range from VIS to thermal infrared (TIR), which enables remote observations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and CH<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, atmospheric constituent data are also available in the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) NASA's atmospheric reanalysis data collection. MERRA-2 uses an upgraded version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) data assimilation system, enhanced with more aspects of the Earth system. <!-- Check this.

Some of these data collections include atmospheric composition products from the ongoing TROPOMI, OMI, OMPS, MLS, TANSO-FTS, and MERRA-2 missions and projects. The GES DISC web site (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov) provides multiple tools designed to help data users easily search, subset, visualize, and download data from these diverse sources in a unified way.

The global precipitation changes follow the magnitude of the warming according to a recent study (Tebaldi, Debeire, Eyring et al., 2020) of the CMIP6 ensemble-mean. However, Earth systems models exhibit a large range in simulated precipitation projection over land. In this study, we present a potential approach to constrain the precipitation changes over land globally and regionally. This approach performs a process-oriented model evaluation similar to Nowack et al. study. We evaluate the ability of models to represent atmospheric dynamical interactions by applying Causal Discovery algorithm. We find a relationship between the ability to represent dynamical interactions close to the observations and the projected precipitation changes over land of the model. We show how this relationship can be used to constrain projection of precipitation over land.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>References:</p><p>Nowack, P., Runge, J., Eyring, V. et al.

The Exoplanet Biosignatures Workshop Without Walls (EBWWW) held in 2016 engaged the international scientific community across diverse scientific disciplines, to assess the state of the science and technology in the search for life on exoplanets, and to identify paths for progress. The workshop activities resulted in five major review papers, which provide (1) an encyclopedic review of known and proposed biosignatures and models used to ascertain them (Schwieterman et al., 2018 in this issue); (2) an in-depth review of O2 as a biosignature, rigorously examining the nuances of false positives and false negatives for evidence of life (Meadows et al., 2018 in this issue); (3) a Bayesian framework to comprehensively organize current understanding to quantify confidence in biosignature assessments (Catling et al., 2018 in this issue); (4) an extension of that Bayesian framework in anticipation of increasing planetary data and novel concepts of biosignatures (Walker et al., 2018 in this issue); and (5) a review of the upcoming telescope capabilities to characterize exoplanets and their environment (Fujii et al., 2018 in this issue). Because of the immense content of these review papers, this summary provides a guide to their complementary scope and highlights salient features. Strong themes that emerged from the workshop were that biosignatures must be interpreted in the context of their environment, and that frameworks must be developed to link diverse forms of scientific understanding of that context to quantify the likelihood that a biosignature has been observed. Models are needed to explore the parameter space where measurements will be widespread but sparse in detail. Given the technological prospects for large ground-based telescopes and space-based observatories, the detection of atmospheric signatures of a few potentially habitable planets may come before 2030.

During that time, all the presentation was held online. The second ISEST was held in March 2023. Although the condition is more relaxed, but many people still cautious, hence the 2nd ISEST was held in hybrid mode. This year, the situation is much better, thus we decided that the seminar will be fully offline. However, due to some circumstances, several presenters cannot join us here and decided to deliver their presentation online. The main theme of the 3rd ISEST is \u201cNavigating the changing world through earth sciences and technology\u201d. The theme emphasizes the adaptable approach to earth related problems, from natural resources utilization to natural disaster management. The main theme is divided into 4 topics, which are Solid Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences, Atmospheric Sciences, and Interdisciplinary Earth Science and Technology. We also have two joint special sessions. The first one today is the Blue Economy special session collaborated with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. In the next day we will have the second special session of Disaster Risk Financing, in collaboration with Directorate General of Budget Financing and Risk Management of Ministry of Finance.

GEOS is developed by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. It generates near\u2010real\u2010time analyzed data products, reanalyses, and weather and seasonal forecasts to support research targeted to understanding interactions among Earth System processes. For chemistry, our efforts are focused on ozone and its influence on the state of the atmosphere and oceans, and on trace gas data assimilation and global forecasting at mesoscale discretization. Several chemistry and aerosol modules are coupled to the GCM, which enables GEOS to address topics pertinent to NASA's Earth Science Mission. This paper describes the atmospheric chemistry components of GEOS and provides an overview of its Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)\u2010based software infrastructure, which promotes a rich spectrum of feedbacks that influence circulation and climate, and impact human and ecosystem health. We detail how GEOS allows model users to select chemical mechanisms and emission scenarios at run time, establish the extent to which the aerosol and chemical components communicate, and decide whether either or both influence the radiative transfer calculations. A variety of resolutions facilitates research on spatial and temporal scales relevant to problems ranging from hourly changes in air quality to trace gas trends in a changing climate. Samples of recent GEOS chemistry applications are provided."}, {"paperId": "131db6986a7a66e9180f036d0a82a0a585c35365", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/131db6986a7a66e9180f036d0a82a0a585c35365", "title": "Coastal-Urban-Rural Atmospheric Gradient Experiment (CoURAGE) Science Plan", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2429693", "status": "GREEN", "license": "other-oa", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2172/2429693?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2172/2429693, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Earth system (climate and weather) models have not yet been adapted to provide accurate predictions of climate and weather variability within cities, nor do they provide well-tested representations of the impacts of urban systems on the atmospheric environment. These limitations are largely due to limited field data available for testing and development of these models. We will deploy the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility\u2019s first Mobile Facility (AMF1) to the mid-Atlantic region surrounding the city of Baltimore for the Coast-Urban-Rural Atmospheric Gradient Experiment (CoURAGE). This deployment will create a four-node regional atmospheric observatory network including Baltimore and its three primary surrounding environments \u2013 rural, urban, and bay. CoURAGE investigators will study the interactions among the Earth\u2019s surface, the atmospheric boundary layer, aerosols and atmospheric composition, clouds, radiation, and precipitation at each site, and examine how the spatial gradients across the region interact to create the climate conditions in Baltimore. This study will determine the degree to which Baltimore\u2019s atmospheric environment depends on interactive feedbacks in the atmospheric system and the degree to which conditions in Baltimore depend on the surrounding environment. Some topics of interest include how urban land management exacerbates heat waves, the impact of regional mesoscale winds (nocturnal jet, bay breeze) on urban air pollution and cloud cover, and the impact of the urban heat island and aerosol production on heavy precipitation events. Understanding this integrated coast-urban-rural system quantitatively and with good accuracy and precision is critical to informing climate adaptation and mitigation efforts in the city of Baltimore . The understanding gained should be applicable to many similar coastal, mid-latitude urban centers. Another important objective of CoURAGE is to improve the representation of the climate of coastal cities in Earth systems models (ESMs). CoURAGE investigators will use the observations to test current ESMs, identify weaknesses and work towards improved simulations of this complex environment. The ARM core facility will be deployed in the city of Baltimore, complementing the Baltimore Social-Environmental Collaborative (BSEC), a"}, {"paperId": "131e25fb80088a7742bfb6f2d4dcc4267aa950d9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/131e25fb80088a7742bfb6f2d4dcc4267aa950d9", "title": "Krakatoa and the Sun-Glows", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/030155a0.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Climatic change in this region interacts with and affects the rate of the global change through atmospheric circulation, biogeophysical, and biogeochemical feedbacks. Changes in the surface energy balance, hydrologic cycle, and carbon budget feedback to regional and global weather and climate systems. Two-thirds of the Northern Hemisphere high latitude land mass resides in Northern Eurasia (~20% of the global land mass), and this region has undergone sweeping socio-economic change throughout the 20th century. How this carbon-rich, cold region component of the Earth system functions as a regional entity and interacts with and feeds back to the greater global system is to a large extent unknown. To mitigate the deficiencies in understanding these feedbacks, which may in turn hamper our understanding of the global change rates and patterns, an initiative was formed. Three years ago the Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI) was established to address large-scale and long-term manifestations of climate and environmental change in this region. The NEESPI Science Plan and its Executive Summary have been published at the NEESPI web site (neespi.org). Since 2004, NEESPI participants have been able to seed several waves of research proposals to international and national funding agencies and institutions and also contribute to the International Polar Year. Currently, NEESPI is widely recognized and endorsed by several Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP) programmes and projects: the International Geosphere and Biosphere Programme, the World Climate Research Programme through the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment and Climate and Cryosphere Projects, the Global Water System Project, Global Carbon Project, Global Land Project, and the Integrated Land Ecosystem?Atmosphere Processes Study. Through NEESPI, more than 100 individually funded projects (always with international participation) in the United States, Russian Federation, China, European Union, Japan, and Canada have been mutually united to explore the scientifically significant Northern Eurasian region. NEESPI scientists have been quite productive during the past two years (2005?2006) publishing more than 200 books, book chapters, and papers in refereed journals. NEESPI sessions at international conferences are open to everyone who works on environmental and climate change problems in Northern Eurasia and the circumpolar boreal zone. This thematic issue brings together articles from the authors who presented their latest results at the Annual Fall American Geophysical Union Meeting in San Francisco (December 2006). The research letters in this issue are preceded by two editorial papers (Leptoukh et al and Sherstyukov et al) devoted to informational support of research in the NEESPI domain that is critical to the success of the Initiative. The following papers are quite diverse and are assembled into five groups devoted to studies of climate and hydrology, land cover and land use, the biogeochemical cycle and its feedbacks, the cryosphere, and human dimensions in the NEESPI domain and the circumpolar boreal zone.

This knowledge and understanding serves the fundamental need to improve our lives on Earth, advancing this frontier for all humanity. NASA pursues both curiosity-driven and practically focused Earth science because our ability to thrive on our home planet is undeniably tied to our scientific understanding and predictive capability of its dynamics and phenomena. ESD explores our rapidly changing world, where natural and human factors interact, following an interdisciplinary, Earth systems approach that examines the interplay among the atmospheric, ocean, land, and ice systems. Using the recommendations of the 2017 NASA Earth Science Decadal Survey, Thriving on Our Changing Planet a Decadal Strategy for Earth Observation from Space, as a compass, ESD is developing the observing systems that will answer the most important science and application questions of the next decade across the following focus areas: \n\n\u2022 Coupling of the water and energy cycles\n\u2022 Ecosystem change\n\u2022 Extending and improving weather and air quality forecasts\n\u2022 Reducing climate uncertainty and informing societal response\n\u2022 Sea-level rise\n\u2022 Surface dynamics, geological hazards and disasters \n\nThe ESD Flight Program develops and operates the observing systems required to address these focus areas. It consists of a coordinated series of satellite and airborne missions for long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. The Flight Program also encompasses infrastructure for operating these missions, processing their scientific data, and distributing them on a free and open basis to researchers, operational users, and the public. The Flight Program currently has 24 operating Earth observing space missions and instruments. There are 18 more missions and instruments in development. These comprise missions recommended by the 2017 NASA Earth Science Decadal Survey, missions and selected instruments to ensure availability of key climate data sets, operational missions to sustain land imaging provided by the Landsat system, and small-sized competitively selected orbital and instrument missions of opportunity belonging to the Earth Venture (EV) program. Projects in development include the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich/-B dual satellite altimetry mission; with its first launch scheduled for November 2020 and the recently selected Libera Earth radiation budget (ERB) instrument planned to be hosted on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Joint Polar Satellite System-3 (JPSS-3) spacecraft. Libera is the first of the new Earth Venture Continuity class of missions promoting innovative, capable approaches to acquiring existing Climate Data Record (CDR) measurement sets at lower cost. The 2017 Earth Science Decadal Survey recommended four new Flight Program elements (Designated, Explorer, and Incubation Targeted Observables) in addition to the legacy missions that comprise the Program of Record (POR). Multi-Center architecture studies for the Designated Targeted Observables and plans to address the other new Flight Program elements are underway.

Its core mechanism lies in leveraging the substantial temperature difference between the Earth\u2019s surface and outer space (3 K) to dissipate heat into the cold universe via electromagnetic waves through the atmospheric transparency window, thereby achieving ubiquitous cooling. Characterized by zero energy consumption and environmental compatibility, radiative cooling offers a practical and effective approach to reducing escalating cooling energy costs and mitigating global warming, which has garnered significant attention in energy and materials science. To enhance daytime radiative cooling performance, researchers have developed advanced functional materials such as photonic structures, porous polymers, polymer-dielectric composites, and hierarchical fibers/textiles. These materials optimize solar reflectance to minimize solar heat gain, and typically exhibit white or silvery appearances. However, such signal chromatic characteristics face aesthetic limitations in architectural applications, and pose risks of light pollution that may harm visual health. This challenge has driven scientific exploration into colored daytime radiative cooling (CDRC) as a viable solution. However, CDRC coatings designed based on structural coloration mechanisms, such Tamm plasmon resonance or Bragg diffraction, typically employ nanoscale layer-by-layer deposition techniques to construct multilayered nanocavity architectures. By precisely controlling the thickness and refractive index gradient of functional layers, the selective absorption of narrow band visible spectra can be achieved. This allows specific colors to be displayed while retaining high near-infrared reflectance. However, the complex structural designs and the high precision requirements in fabrication processes hider the large-scale application of such multilayer structural-color radiative cooling materials. Therefore, we propose a scalable bilayer-structured CDRC coating for building cooling.

We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere <350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite \u2265 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (<5% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (<4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (<15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of <10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social-ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of \"planetary boundaries\" lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the \"planetary playing field\" for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale."}, {"paperId": "13856f5e77c2ed2fe4c75623f9bb0aa8737b2121", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13856f5e77c2ed2fe4c75623f9bb0aa8737b2121", "title": "Environmental and Behavioral Influences on Karenia Brevis' Nitrate Uptake", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6856336", "name": "G.

Super-Earths could possess a large amount of molecular hydrogen depending on disk, planetary, and stellar properties. Super-Earths orbiting pre-main-sequence M-dwarf stars have been suggested to possess large amounts of O2(g) produced abiotically via water photolysis followed by hydrogen escape. If these two constituents were present simultaneously, such large amounts of H2(g) and O2(g) can react via photochemistry to form up to \u223c10 Earth oceans. In cases where photochemical removal is slow, hence O2(g) can indeed build up abiotically, the atmosphere could reach the combustion\u2013explosion limit. Then, H2(g) and O2(g) react extremely quickly to release energy and form liquid water together with modest amounts of hydrogen peroxide. These processes set constraints for H2(g) and O2(g) atmospheric compositions in Super-Earth atmospheres. Our initial study of the gas-phase oxidation pathways for modest conditions (Earth\u2019s insolation and \u223c10th of a percent of H2(g)) suggests that H2(g) is oxidized by O2(g) into H2O(g) mostly via HOx and mixed HOx\u2013NOx catalyzed cycles. Regarding other pairs of atmospheric species, we find that CO\u2013O2 could attain explosive\u2013combustive levels on mini gas planets for midrange C/O in the equilibrium chemistry regime (p > \u223c1 bar). Regarding (CH4\u2013O2), a small number of modeled rocky planets assuming Earth-like atmospheres orbiting cooler stars could have compositions at or near the explosive\u2013combustive level although more work is required to investigate this issue."}, {"paperId": "13f1f0772d379c79025c98d2ec863b396795b837", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13f1f0772d379c79025c98d2ec863b396795b837", "title": "25.4 A 0.43K-noise-equivalent-\u0394T 100GHz dicke-free radiometer with 100% time efficiency in 65nm CMOS", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

In the early 1960\u2019s teams from Stanford University and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory exploited radio links between Earth and the Mariner 3 and 4 spacecraft to probe the atmosphere and other properties of Mars. Radio science has since been a staple of planetary exploration. Before the advent of GPS, application of radio occultation to Earth was deemed impractical, and it was not immediately evident that even GPS could be usefully adapted. Techniques devised for geodesy in the 1980\u2019s, including \u201ccodeless\u201d carrier reconstruction, clock elimination by double differencing, GPS-based precise orbit determination, and compact, low-cost receivers, set the stage. JPL submitted the first GPS occultation proposal to NASA in 1988. Though that \u201cGPS Geoscience Instrument\u201d did not fly, it established the concept and led soon to the GPS/MET experiment, conceived by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and sponsored by the US National Science Foundation. The remarkable success of GPSIMET has led NASA to mount follow-on experiments on five international missions, launching between 1999 and 2001. Those will refine the systems and techniques of GPS sounding, setting the stage for COSMIC-the first operational GPS occultation constellation."}, {"paperId": "148a69fc123c281acb586a24eb2a8159135d477e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/148a69fc123c281acb586a24eb2a8159135d477e", "title": "Molybdenum Behavior during High-Pressure Metamorphism", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.46427/gold2020.2149", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.46427/gold2020.2149?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.46427/gold2020.2149, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On terrestrial planets, the silicate mantle is a large source of water, which can be outgassed into the atmosphere via volcanism. Outgassing is subject to a series of feedback processes between atmosphere and interior, which continually shape both atmospheric composition, pressure, and temperature, as well as interior dynamics. For example, water has a high solubility in surface lava, which can strongly limit its outgassing into the atmosphere even at low atmospheric pressures. In contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> can be easily outgassed. This drives up the surface pressure and temperature, potentially preventing further water outgassing [1].</p>\n<p>We present the results of an extensive parameter study, where we use a newly developed 1D numerical model to simulate the coupled evolution of the atmosphere and interior of terrestrial exoplanets up to 5 Earth masses around Sun-like stars, with internal structures ranging from Moon- to Mercury-like. The model accounts for the main mechanisms controlling the global-scale, long-term evolution of stagnant-lid rocky planets (i.e. bodies without plate tectonics), and it includes a large number of atmosphere-interior feedback processes, such as a CO<sub>2</sub> weathering cycle, volcanic outgassing based on the pressure-dependent solubility of volatiles in surface lava, a water cycle between ocean and atmosphere, greenhouse heating, as well as the influence of a primordial H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, which can be lost through escape processes. While many atmosphere-interior feedback processes have been studied before in detail (e.g. [2, 3]), we present here a comprehensive model combining the important planetary processes across a wide range of terrestrial planets.</p>\n<p>We find that a significant majority of high-density exoplanets (i.e. Mercury-like planets with large cores) are able to outgas and sustain water on their surface. In contrast, most planets with intermediate, Earth-like densities either transition into a runaway greenhouse regime due to strong CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing, or retain part of their primordial atmosphere, which prevents water from being outgassed. This suggests that high-density planets could be the most promising targets when searching for suitable candidates for hosting liquid water. Furthermore, the degeneracy of the interior structures of high-density planets is limited compared to that of planets with Earth-like density, which further facilitates the characterization of these bodies, and our results predict largely uniform atmospheric compositions across the range of high-density planets, which could be verified by future spectroscopic measurements.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>[1] Tosi, N. <em>et al.</em> The habitability of a stagnant-lid earth. <em>A&A</em> <strong>605</strong>, A71 (2017).</p>\n<p>[2] Noack, L., Rivoldini, A. & Van Hoolst, T.

Therefore, the management of cattle has major implications for natural vegetation, soils, biodiversity, and atmospheric greenhouse gases in Australia and globally. To meet global sustainability targets and consumer expectations, a variety of environmental Standards, Certification and Assurance (SCA) schemes are being developed and implemented to enable producers to verify claims relating to their products. Improved standardization and coordination are now needed to address the rapid proliferation of credentialing systems that use different frameworks, methods and levels of scientific verification. Using the Australian grass-fed beef industry as a case study, we identified the measures, metrics and methods that are currently used by SCA schemes for climate and biodiversity credentialing. From here, a co-design process with industry representatives was applied to develop recommendations for credentialing in extensive beef production, feedlots and meat processing. It was clear that the successful adoption of credentialing by beef producers will require flexible and user-friendly support tools that use scalable data sources such as existing producer records, agtech databases and remote sensing information. Substantive rewards and incentives will be required to support producer engagement with the SCA schemes. Overall, \u2019more needs to be done to ensure the transparency of schemes and to meet benchmarks for integrity such as determining uncertainty and support though peer-reviewed science."}, {"paperId": "14e0486dc30fb4a0f9b4d3edadee5d2c8108b3b4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14e0486dc30fb4a0f9b4d3edadee5d2c8108b3b4", "title": "Chemostratigraphy Across the Triassic\u2013Jurassic Boundary", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/83/11193824/1119382483-49.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/9781119382508.CH10?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119382508.CH10, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This was accompanied by significant perturbations in ocean and atmosphere geochemistry, including the global carbon cycle, as expressed by major fluctuations in carbon isotope ratios. Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) volcanism triggered environmental changes and played a key role in this biotic crisis. Biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic studies link the end\u2010Triassic mass extinction with the early phases of CAMP volcanism, and notable mercury enrichments in geographically distributed marine and continental strata are shown to be coeval with the onset of the extrusive emplacement of CAMP. Sulfuric acid induced atmospheric aerosol clouds from subaerial CAMP volcanism can explain a brief, relatively cool seawater temperature pulse in the mid\u2010paleolatitude Pan\u2010European seaway across the T\u2013J transition. The occurrence of CAMP\u2010induced carbon degassing may explain the overall long\u2010term shift toward much warmer conditions. The effect of CAMP volcanism on seawater 87Sr/86Sr values might have been indirect by driving enhanced continental weathering intensity.

The newest generation of Earth system models (ESMs) has shown substantial improvements in the ability to simulate the early Eocene global mean surface temperature (GMST) and equator-to-pole gradient. Results using the Community Earth System Model suggest that parameterizations of atmospheric radiation, convection, and clouds largely determine the Eocene GMST and are responsible for improvements in the new ESMs, but they have less direct influence on the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. ESMs still have difficulty simulating some regional and seasonal temperatures, although improved data reconstructions of chronology, spatial coverage, and seasonal resolution are needed for more robust model assessment. Looking forward, key processes including radiation and clouds need to be benchmarked and improved using more accurate models of limited domain/physics. Earth system processes need to be better explored, leveraging the increasing ESM resolution and complexity. \u25aa Earth system models (ESMs) are now able to simulate the large-scale features of the early Eocene. \u25aa Remaining model-data discrepancies exist at regional and seasonal scales and require improvements in both proxy data and ESMs. \u25aa A hierarchical modeling approach is needed to ensure relevant physical processes are parameterized reasonably well in ESMs. \u25aa Future work is needed to leverage the continuously increasing resolution and complexity of ESMs. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Volume 52 is May 2024.

In addition to their impact on the Earth\u2019s climate system, aerosols from volcanic eruptions, wildfires, man-made pollution events and dust storms are hazardous to aviation safety and human health. Space-based lidar systems provide critical information about the vertical distributions of clouds and aerosols that greatly improve our understanding of the climate system. However, daytime data from backscatter lidars, such as the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) on the International Space Station (ISS), must be averaged during science processing at the expense of spatial resolution to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for accurately detecting atmospheric features. For example, 50% of all atmospheric features reported in daytime operational CATS data products require averaging to 60 km for detection. Furthermore, the single-wavelength nature of the CATS primary operation mode makes accurately typing these features challenging in complex scenes. This paper presents machine learning (ML) techniques that, when applied to CATS data, (1) increased the 1064 nm SNR by 75%, (2) increased the number of layers detected (any resolution) by 30%, and (3) enabled detection of 40% more atmospheric features during daytime operations at a horizontal resolution of 5 km compared to the 60 km horizontal resolution often required for daytime CATS operational data products. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained using CATS standard data products also demonstrated the potential for improved cloud-aerosol discrimination compared to the operational CATS algorithms for cloud edges and complex near-surface scenes during daytime."}, {"paperId": "15cb0778572e99fde529718fdd6c7c9e2fb15c67", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15cb0778572e99fde529718fdd6c7c9e2fb15c67", "title": "Atmospheric and Science Complexity Effects on Surface Bidirectional Reflectance", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47479295", "name": "D.

Despite these successes, the application of causal discovery to space\u2010time systems remains immensely challenging due to the high\u2010dimensional nature of the data. For example, in climate sciences, modern observational temperature records over the past few decades regularly measure thousands of locations around the globe. To address these challenges, we introduce Causal Space\u2010Time Stencil Learning (CaStLe), a novel meta\u2010algorithm for discovering causal structures in complex space\u2010time systems. CaStLe leverages regularities in local space\u2010time dependencies to learn governing global dynamics. This local perspective eliminates spurious confounding and drastically reduces sample complexity, making space\u2010time causal discovery practical and effective. For causal discovery, CaStLe flexibly accepts any appropriately adapted time series causal discovery algorithm to recover local causal structures. These advances enable causal discovery of geophysical phenomena that were previously unapproachable, including non\u2010periodic, transient phenomena such as volcanic eruption plumes. Regularities in local space\u2010time dependencies are transformed into informative spatial replicates, which actually improve CaStLe's performance when applied to ever\u2010larger spatial grids. We successfully apply CaStLe to discover the atmospheric dynamics governing the climate response to the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. We provide validation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CaStLe over existing causal\u2010discovery frameworks on a range of geophysics\u2010inspired benchmarks while identifying the method's limitations and domains where its assumptions may not hold."}, {"paperId": "15e6e1246503b8003a91847276e44de9fb0fafb8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15e6e1246503b8003a91847276e44de9fb0fafb8", "title": "The role of eddies in buoyancy flux", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46628676", "name": "M.

Rogelj"}], "abstract": "In this \u201cGrand Challenges\u201d paper, we review how the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 has changed since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities and their influence on the natural carbon cycle, and we provide new estimates of possible future changes for a range of scenarios. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change reduce the ratio of 13C/12C in atmospheric CO2 (\u03b413CO2). This is because 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis and \u03b413C in plant\u2010derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and fossil fuels is lower than atmospheric \u03b413CO2. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion also reduce the ratio of 14C/C in atmospheric CO2 (\u039414CO2) because 14C is absent in million\u2010year\u2010old fossil fuels, which have been stored for much longer than the radioactive decay time of 14C. Atmospheric \u039414CO2 rapidly increased in the 1950s to 1960s because of 14C produced during nuclear bomb testing. The resulting trends in \u03b413C and \u039414C in atmospheric CO2 are influenced not only by these human emissions but also by natural carbon exchanges that mix carbon between the atmosphere and ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This mixing caused \u039414CO2 to return toward preindustrial levels in the first few decades after the spike from nuclear testing. More recently, as the bomb 14C excess is now mostly well mixed with the decadally overturning carbon reservoirs, fossil fuel emissions have become the main factor driving further decreases in atmospheric \u039414CO2. For \u03b413CO2, in addition to exchanges between reservoirs, the extent to which 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis appears to have increased, slowing down the recent \u03b413CO2 trend slightly. A new compilation of ice core and flask \u03b413CO2 observations indicates that the decline in \u03b413CO2 since the preindustrial period is less than some prior estimates, which may have incorporated artifacts owing to offsets from different laboratories' measurements. Atmospheric observations of \u03b413CO2 have been used to investigate carbon fluxes and the functioning of plants, and they are used for comparison with \u03b413C in other materials such as tree rings. Atmospheric observations of \u039414CO2 have been used to quantify the rate of air\u2010sea gas exchange and ocean circulation, and the rate of net primary production and the turnover time of carbon in plant material and soils. Atmospheric observations of \u039414CO2 are also used for comparison with \u039414C in other materials in many fields such as archaeology, forensics, and physiology. Another major application is the assessment of regional emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion using \u039414CO2 observations and models. In the future, \u03b413CO2 and \u039414CO2 will continue to change. The sign and magnitude of the changes are mainly determined by global fossil fuel emissions. We present here simulations of future \u03b413CO2 and \u039414CO2 for six scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Applications using atmospheric \u03b413CO2 and \u039414CO2 observations in carbon cycle science and many other fields will be affected by these future changes. We recommend an increased effort toward making coordinated measurements of \u03b413C and \u039414C across the Earth System and for further development of isotopic modeling and model\u2010data analysis tools."}, {"paperId": "163bd436bc0a7fb63ca9d7eb8ddb0fe062308292", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/163bd436bc0a7fb63ca9d7eb8ddb0fe062308292", "title": "30 years of measurements at SMEAR II station \u2013 practical work at a field station and how it has changed during decades", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/aca.8.e150502?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/aca.8.e150502, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

SMEAR II (Station for Measuring Earth surface - Atmosphere Relations) by INAR (Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research, University of Helsinki) is the leading measurement station in ecosystem\u2013atmosphere interactions with continuous and mostly automatic measurements of ca. 1200 parameters. SMEAR II belongs to ICOS, ACTRIS, eLTER, and AnaEE. In addition to our own measurements, SMEAR II hosts scientific visitors and their campaigns. Here, we discuss how the scope of the work has both changed and expanded during its 30 years of operation and especially in relation to the establishment of the above-mentioned research infrastructures (RIs). We describe the changes from the viewpoint of the technical and research staff working either permanently at the station or tightly related to SMEAR II measurements and data management. While we only deal with a single site, we believe that many discussed aspects are either universal or applicable to many similar stations. \n Different field stations have different focus points and those can also change with time, e.g. due to the development of RIs. What is in common for all field sites is that the activities are versatile and varying continuously, affecting also the everyday work. Therefore, the skills needed for field site work are wide-ranging. As the activities at SMEAR II have grown, the number of onsite staff has increased in 30 years from one to 14. With growing number of staff with different educational backgrounds and duties, the importance of a well-functioning working community has increased. Furthermore, the significance of planning and prioritizing the work has increased during the site operation period and further with RIs. The increased number of staff has led to more specified set of tasks for most employees even though, as said, field site work is in any case versatile. Larger community, more specified tasks, more extensive development projects and overall, maintaining a wide scoped functioning site also requires active development of communication methods. \n One of the most obvious changes at SMEAR II is that while in the early years scientists spent long time periods at the site collecting data for their own research and sharing ideas, over time the operating principle has changed towards the site being a data factory where the local staff conducts their duties as \u201doffice work\u201d. This change is enhanced by the progression of RIs since measurements need to develop in a long-term and comparable manner to fulfil RIs\u00b4 requirements. This, in turn opens possibilities to resolve novel, wide-scope, global-scale questions and increase the site\u00b4s scientific impact. \n With the development of RIs, requirements for data management concerning both the amount of work and amount of data storage space have greatly increased. For SMEAR II, a large part of data management is conducted by INAR data management team. They are not working permanently at the site, but having a dedicated staff is a clear advantage for data quality. This also adds an extra layer to the data pipeline from the instrumentation to a ready data file, further emphasizing the need for active communication. SMEAR II had an open data policy already before RIs but the large RI databases further enable high-impact research and promote the use of data worldwide. The development of the RIs has not only improved the documentation of the site and its measurements, but also the installations, calibrations etc. Better documentation and more harmonized data processing further simplifies the wide use of data. However, the clearly increased workload related to data management highlights the need for as uniform data policies, data processing and submission procedures as possible among different RIs. \n The importance of maintaining basic infrastructure is one very important but -if everything works- quite an invisible aspect of field site work. As the number of measurements and requirements for the data stability increase, also the share of work time that is allocated for basic infrastructure increases. Failures in power, network or pressurized air mean breaks in data flow and lower data quality, and therefore repairing the failures quickly and the continuous maintenance to prevent those are crucial. For example, SMEAR II used to suffer from frequent power breaks, causing quite a workload, until setting up a backup power system in 2017 improved the situation. Snow work during winter, adjusting the temperatures of the instrument spaces, renewing wooden pathways within the forest area, maintenance of tower structures, removing wasp hives and coppice clearing are other examples of basic infrastructure maintenance that are needed to keep the site in operation. \n Even though not directly related to RIs, the improvement in working conditions, regarding e.g. safety and equality has been significant and thus we want to raise it up here. This improves work wellbeing and decreases accidents. However, it is also noteworthy that developing safety regulations also require creating new procedures as the methods or equipment that were used before are not considered appropriate anymore. \n Another, not directly RI linked change is the noticeable increase in societal interaction performed at the site during the last ten years. Societal interaction at SMEAR II includes e.g. science education for students of ages 5-18, science trail introducing the research done at the site and hosting Pirkanmaa climate action lab that promotes climate related discussion and solutions among municipalities, parishes, companies and universities. These activities offer multitude ways of increasing the use and the overall impact of the field site."}, {"paperId": "1640710c0c0451d5d63142accf07e9fe59bd3539", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1640710c0c0451d5d63142accf07e9fe59bd3539", "title": "Airborne Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer System for Tropospheric Trace Species Detection", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1946239", "name": "A.

Here, we show that we can use a machine learning unsupervised k\u2010means++ clustering method combined with expert aggregation of clusters to identify the pathways of the Labrador Current from a large set of modeled Lagrangian trajectories. The presented method requires simple pre\u2010processing of the data, including a Cartesian correction on longitudes and a principal component analysis reduction. The clustering is performed in a kernelized space and uses a larger number of clusters than the number of expected pathways. To identify the main pathways, similar clusters are grouped into pathway categories by experts in the circulation of the region of interest. We find that the Labrador Current mainly follows a westward\u2010flowing and an eastward retroflecting pathway (20% and 50% of the flow, respectively) that compensate each other through time in a see\u2010saw behavior. These pathways experience a strong variability (representing through time 4%\u201342% and 24%\u201373% of the flow, respectively). Two thirds of the retroflection occurs at the tip of the Grand Banks, and one quarter at Flemish Cap. The westward pathway is mostly fed by the on\u2010shelf branch of the Labrador Current, and the eastward pathway by the shelf\u2010break branch. Among the pathways of secondary importance, we identify a previously unreported one that feeds the subtropics across the Gulf Stream."}, {"paperId": "1665ebb5c7a475e06dcc3fcdaa77cbe5a66bec4c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1665ebb5c7a475e06dcc3fcdaa77cbe5a66bec4c", "title": "Fung receives 2004 Roger Revelle Medal", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

This AI-based emulator is needed for model calibration, sensitivity analysis, prediction, uncertainty quantification, and decision making. This AI-based emulator will incorporate physics and biological information in the form of conservation laws and constitutive relationships. Science Challenge DOE\u2019s demographic vegetation model, the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Simulator (FATES), allows comparison with many more observable vegetation processes than the first generation \u2018big leaf\u2019 vegetation models, but also faces two key challenges. First, FATES contains more degrees of freedom leading to greater complexity and more uncertainties in the parameter estimations. Second, because more processes (e.g., vegetation recruitment, growth and mortality) are introduced, FATES is computationally much more expensive. These two challenges make it difficult to calibrate the model against observations using traditional approaches for parameter estimation (e.g., maximum likelihood or Markov Chain Monte-Carlo). One solution is to build emulators to efficiently mimic these demographic vegetation models; however, due to the larger number of parameters and model complexity, it is only feasible to build emulators with a constrained and limited number of key parameters based on traditional kernel methods 1. Rationale Earth System models (ESMs) are evolved from the general circulation models (GCMs), which mainly focus on the physical process of ocean and atmospheric circulations, with a new focus on the climate feedbacks from biological systems2. An important biological component is vegetation, which plays a critical role in global and regional water cycles3. Specifically, the reduction in plant productivity and increasing vegetation mortality resulting from extreme climate conditions could substantially affect the regional and global water cycles 3,4. The first-generation vegetation models represent plant communities by area-averaged leaf layers of different plant functional types (PFTs) within each land grid cell. However, these bigleaf vegetation models do not represent the coexistence of different sizes of plants or PFTs, meaning that these models cannot express the competition for light, water, and nutrients among plants. To overcome these limitations, scientists have incorporated ecosystem demographic models into ESMs5,6. These new models include an ecosystem\u2019s demographics by explicitly simulating plant size, diameter growth, mortality, and recruitment based on competition for light, nutrients, and water5. Because these demographic vegetation models explicitly represent the coexistence and competition among different size groups of PFTs, they are expected to better represent changes in regional and global water cycles associated with disturbances. Specifically, DOE\u2019s FATES is considered a next-generation vegetation model for E3SM, with a size-structured group of plants (cohorts) and successional trajectory-based patches using the ecosystem demography approach7. Within FATES, the transpiration rate is mainly determined by leaf-level photosynthesis, competition as determined by growth and mortality, and hydraulic function changes under water stress. FATES allocates photosynthetic carbon to storage and different tissues, such as leaf, root, and stem based on the allometry of different plant species. Mortality within FATES is simulated by carbon starvation caused by depletion of carbon storage"}, {"paperId": "1708830df7e9ed7dd0aa8a6fe5d1a78d002576bc", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1708830df7e9ed7dd0aa8a6fe5d1a78d002576bc", "title": "UK Solar System Planetary Atmospheres Meeting 2020", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1438305774", "name": "N.

Schellnhuber"}], "abstract": "On January 28, 2021, the world lost a scholar, who won a Nobel Prize, who shaped our thinking about planet Earth, and whose fight for the protection of the global environment will be remembered forever. Paul Josef Crutzen was born in Amsterdam in 1933 and embarked on a cosmopolitan journey in 1957, when he left The Netherlands for Sweden. Looking back at that journey, we can state that he arrived at a triad of accomplishments that few intellectuals obtain: the disruptive advancement of science, the inspiring communication of science, and the responsible operationalization of science. Paul was trained as a civil engineer for the construction sector, which he abandoned for becoming a computer programmer at the Meteorology Institute of Stockholm University (MISU). The university housed the world\u2019s fastest computers at that time, and the institute, founded by the great Gustav Rossby, was at the forefront of atmospheric research. When Paul arrived, MISU was headed by another giant of meteorology, Bert Bolin, who later became the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Paul had always longed for an academic career due to his interest and talent in mathematics and physics, yet was denied access to university education in The Netherlands by an unfortunate episode of illness. So, while helping develop numerical weather forecasting models for various projects, he also took lecture courses at Stockholm University, was graduated there, and eventually received a doctorate in meteorology in 1968. When he in turn became a member of the MISU faculty, Paul did not join the mainstream then preoccupied with \u201cacid rain.\u201d Instead, he jumped to stratospheric chemistry out of sheer curiosity, which was ignited by his accidental involvement in a previous project, illustrating oncemore the general observation that greatness tends to be approached via narrow and tortuous side paths. Later in his career, Paul held positions in the United States (National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, 1977 to 1980) and Germany (Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, from 1980 onwards), while also teaching as a visiting professor in various other locations around the globe. Yet it was in Stockholm where he pursued his epochal work on the photochemistry of the stratosphere in general, and the stability of the ozone layer in particular. The latter, mainly found between 15 and 35 km above ground, protects life on Earth since it absorbs up to 99% of the Sun\u2019s mediumfrequency UV light. It is a rather brittle shield, though, that can be damaged by human interference in amazingly intricate ways: for example, by reactions that involve nitrogen oxides originating from agricultural fertilizers and possibly also from high-flying supersonic airplanes. Paul discovered and unraveled a specific catalytic cycle in the middle atmosphere that can act as a powerful destroyer of ozone (1). A few years later, in pursuit of a completely independent path toward understanding civilization\u2019s imprint on the composition of the stratosphere, Sherwood (Sherry) Rowland and Mario Molina performed experimental and Paul J. Crutzen.

Chizhevsky opened a new page in the science of man in his connection with world history and space and physical factors influencing its course. In subsequent works on ionization in the gaseous medium (atmospheric air) and liquids (aqueous solutions of the body and blood plasma), the scientist showed that electromagnetic oscillations and corpuscular flows of the external environment interact by electrical exchange and quantum mechanical effects with the electronic structures of cells, tissues, organs, blood, and intercellular body liquid. The external environment, being under the influence of the Sun power and its periodic activity, is in direct communication with the internal environment of the body, and the Earth's psychosphere (collective humanity) and individuals are under the constant influence of these forces. For a scientist, the nature of the so-called Z-rays, which are responsible for translating the potential energy of the external environment into the kinetic energy of the mental-psychological structure of man, remained mysterious. He was convinced that they were connected by a single substrate, and monism was the principle of the evolution of nature and society. Based on the concepts of \"historiometry\" and \"natural-historical knowledge\", the scientist proposed an original periodization of the worldhistorical process and expressed confidence in their use for state-building and world politics.

The study revealed a dependence of the spectral ratio on the particle size for absorbing and non-absorbing wavelengths of the incoming radiation. The research was conducted using a database of light scattering matrices from the Institute of Atmospheric Optics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, based on data obtained through physical optics for the case of chaotic spatial orientation of the particles and single scattering. Several particle shapes characteristic of ice clouds were examined at wavelengths of the incoming radiation from 0.355 to 2.15 micrometers. The obtained results can be used for the interpretation of laser sounding data of crystalline clouds from both the Earth and space."}, {"paperId": "17138048414599b7ac1798c25e743e4ccb1f127a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17138048414599b7ac1798c25e743e4ccb1f127a", "title": "Petrogenesis and magmatic process of the Ikoma gabbroic complex in Kinki district, southwest Japan", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143721241", "name": "Toshiro Takahashi"}, {"authorId": "51177965", "name": "Y.

Moragas"}], "abstract": "Air pollution is a serious issue that affects human health, the environment and the climate at levels from local to global scales. The main processes that affect air pollution levels are: emissions, chemistry, transport and deposition. Air quality models (AQMs) are mathematical tools that describe relevant physicochemical processes and quantify concentrations of air pollutants. Therefore, AQMs can be used to develop and detail measures taken to reduce air quality problems. \nSeveral AQMs are currently used and they have undergone a rapid evolution in recent years. Computer capacity has increased during the last decade enabling us to use higher spatial resolutions and more complex parameterizations schemes that resolve more complex atmospheric processes. Moreover, previous research has shown that the feedbacks between meteorology and chemistry are important in the context of many research applications. Therefore, this increase in computing power allows accurately simulate those feedbacks (online modelling). Online models are becoming more used in the atmospheric community. \nThe NMMB/BSC Chemical Transport Model (NMMB/BSC-CTM) is being developed through an ongoing team effort at the Earth Sciences Department of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The main motivation for this thesis is to contribute in the development of a unified fully coupled chemical weather prediction system able to solve gas-aerosol-meteorology interactions within a wide range of scales on local to global domains that can be used in both operational and research applications. In this sense, the focus in this Ph.D. has been on the development and evaluation of the tropospheric gas-phase chemistry within the online Global / Regional atmospheric model NMMB/BSC-CTM. With the meteorological core NMMB as the starting point, different parameterizations of several atmospheric chemistry processes such as dry deposition, photolysis, wet deposition, gas-phase chemistry, and stratospheric ozone handling have been reviewed, implemented and evaluated during this Ph.D. thesis. \nA complete spatial, temporal and vertical model evaluation of the relevant chemical species using different observational data has been performed in this Ph.D. thesis. Observational data has included ground-monitoring stations, ozonesondes, satellite data, climatologies and, aircraft campaigns. This is the first time that the gas-phase chemistry of the NMMB/BSC-CTM has been evaluated on a regional and global scales over a full year. Concerning the model evaluation in the regional scale, we had the opportunity to participate in the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) Phase2 which aims to intercompare online coupled regional-scale \nmodels over North America and Europe. In this sense, we were participating in this initiative in the European runs with NMMB/BSC-CTM model. The model evaluations have shown a good agreement with observations. Overall, the model performance corresponds to state-of-the-art regional and global AQMs.\n La contaminaci\u00f3 de l\u2019aire \u00e9s un problema greu que afecta la salut humana i el medi ambient, tant a escala local com global. Els principals processos que concerneixen els nivells de contaminaci\u00f3 de l\u2019aire s\u00f3n les emissions, la qu\u00edmica, el transport i la deposici\u00f3. Els Models de Qualitat de \nl\u2019Aire (AQMS) s\u00f3n eines matem\u00e0tiques que descriuen aquests processos fisicoqu\u00edmics i quantifiquen les concentracions de contaminants de l\u2019aire. Per tant, els AQMS es poden utilitzar per desenvolupar i detallar les mesures preses per reduir la mala qualitat de l\u2019aire. Actualment, es fan servir diversos AQMS i aquests darrers anys han evolucionat molt r\u00e0pidament. \nLa capacitat de la computaci\u00f3 ha augmentat durant l\u2019\u00faltima d\u00e8cada, i aix\u00f2 ha fet possible una resoluci\u00f3 espacial m\u00e9s bona i uns esquemes de parametritzacions m\u00e9s complexos que resolen m\u00e9s processos atmosf\u00e8rics. D\u2019una altra banda, la investigaci\u00f3 ha demostrat que els feedbacks entre la meteorologia i la qu\u00edmica s\u00f3n certament importants en moltes aplicacions de recerca. Per tant, l\u2019augment de la pot\u00e8ncia de c\u00e0lcul permet simular acuradament aquests feedbacks (modelizaci\u00f3 online). Els models online s\u00f3n cada vegada m\u00e9s utilitzats en la comunitat atmosf\u00e8rica. \nEl NMMB/BSC Chemical Transport Model (NMMB/BSC-CTM) es desenvolupa gr\u00e0cies a un esfor\u00e7 d\u2019equip al Departament de Ci\u00e8ncies de la Terra del Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). La principal motivaci\u00f3 d\u2019aquesta tesi \u00e9s contribuir al desenvolupament i a l\u2019avaluaci\u00f3 d\u2019un sistema de predicci\u00f3 unificat que sigui capa\u00e7 de resoldre les interaccions gas-aerosolmeteorologia dins un ampli rang d\u2019escales, des de dominis locals a globals, i que pugui ser utilitzat tant en aplicacions operatives com d\u2019investigaci\u00f3. En aquest sentit, el principal objectiu d\u2019aquesta tesi doctoral \u00e9s el desenvolupament i l\u2019avaluaci\u00f3 de la qu\u00edmica troposf\u00e8rica en fase gasosa del model online global/regional NMMB/BSC-CTM. Utilitzant el nucli meteorol\u00f2gic NMMB com a punt de partida, diverses parametritzacions de processos qu\u00edmics atmosf\u00e8rics com ara la deposici\u00f3 seca, la fot\u00f2lisi, la qu\u00edmica dels n\u00favol, la qu\u00edmica en fase gasosa i l\u2019intercanvi d\u2019oz\u00f3 entre estratosfera i troposfera han estat revisats, implementats i avaluats durant aquesta tesi doctoral. \nS\u2019ha dut a terme una avaluaci\u00f3 completa a nivell espacial, temporal i vertical de les esp\u00e8cies qu\u00edmiques m\u00e9s rellevants mitjan\u00e7ant diverses observacions a escala global i regional. Aquestes observacions inclouen estacions a nivell de superf\u00edcie, ozonosondes, dades de sat\u00e8l.lit, \nclimatologies i campanyes d\u2019aeronaus. \u00c9s la primera vegada que la qu\u00edmica en fase gasosa de l\u2019NMMB/BSC-CTM s\u2019avalua a escala global i regional durant un any complet. Respecte l\u2019evaluaci\u00f3 del model a nivell regional, vam tenir l\u2019oportunitat de participar en el projecte de l\u2019Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) Phase2. \nL\u2019objectiu principal d\u2019aquest projecte \u00e9s la intercomparaci\u00f3 de models online a escala regional sobre l\u2019Am\u00e8rica del Nord i Europa. El nostre grup va participar en aquesta iniciativa sobre el domini europeu utilitzant el model NMMB/BSC-CTM. L\u2019avaluaci\u00f3 del model mostra una bona avinen\u00e7a amb les observacions. En general, els resultats del model es corresponen amb l\u2019estat de l\u2019art dels AQMS a escala regional i global."}, {"paperId": "176bfe39fc78c2fa5ff75f10f1202acc76aaa254", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/176bfe39fc78c2fa5ff75f10f1202acc76aaa254", "title": "Multiscale Simulation of Land Use Impact on Soil Erosion and Deposition Patterns", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2878879", "name": "H.

By the middle and second half of the century, it was clear that the atmosphere\u2019s ability to retain heat was mainly due to water vapor and carbon dioxide, and that changes in their quantity would lead to changes in the Earth\u2019s climate. Even then, industrial activity was already known to emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide, and at the turn of the 19th century to the 20th, it was suggested that coal combustion could change the planet\u2019s climate over time. The first attempts to demonstrate the climate-changing effects of human activity were made in the 1930s, but it was not until the mid-20th century that there was clear evidence for carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere, largely as a result of human activity. This paper highlights some of the perhaps less widely known episodes in atmospheric greenhouse research. This historical review of science also makes the reader aware that today\u2019s climate research is no longer primarily concerned with the causes of current climate change, but with the rate and extent to which the highly complex climate system is responding to the atmospheric energy forcing."}, {"paperId": "177b3c86eb50baccb58217971e79076e02527d3b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/177b3c86eb50baccb58217971e79076e02527d3b", "title": "Insights into glacial terminations from a South Atlantic perspective", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

It has been one of the best performing (in terms of returned photons per viewing period and range uncertainty) of a handful of similar sites worldwide. The purpose of installing a superconducting gravimeter (SG) in 2009 was to improve the determination of local deformation, directly affecting the telescope motions, as part of an effort to reduce the error in lunar distance to the mm level. We have now accumulated 10\u00a0years of gravity measurements, together with data from a nearby permanent GPS Plate Boundary Observatory (P027) site. This paper describes the traditional analysis of SG data to produce a local tidal model and to determine a number of necessary dynamic corrections that are specific to the site, of which local atmospheric and hydrology attraction and loading are the most important. Loading corrections are available through the Ecole et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre (EOST) website as part of the International Earth Rotation Service, and we consider 12 different EOST loading series for global atmosphere and hydrology loading and attraction. Nonetheless, local hydrology can only be addressed at the required level of detail using local models determined directly from the gravity data. We devote a major portion of the paper to the development of several water storage and conceptual tank models that succeed in reducing the large seasonal variance of the SG residuals by more than 90%. Yet there remain episodes in the corrected residuals that depart by up to 4 \u03bcGal\u2009from the hydrological models, and the mean error of our fit remains between 1.5-2.0 \u03bcGal\u2009for our two data sets, 2009-2012 and 2013-2018 respectively. Unfortunately the vertical GPS data relies on the UNAVCO processing, and has typically poor vertical accuracy. We find the correlation between the GPS and gravity residuals to be correspondingly weak, and then discuss briefly the incorporation of the displacement and gravity data into the Planetary Ephemeris Program for solving for the lunar distance."}, {"paperId": "17818f93261342a9efa686d6acf75060b183245f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17818f93261342a9efa686d6acf75060b183245f", "title": "Sea-level change", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

It is an element of the ESA Earth Watch programme and is expected to be launched in 2024 on a low earth polar orbit. The instrument is based on three spectral imagers that will measure in UV-vis-NIR wavelength range and will operate in different viewing geometry: limb scattering and occultation of the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars. ALTIUS will retrieve vertical profiles of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, aerosol extinction, among others.</p><p>In this study, we present an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) of ALTIUS ozone profiles that we have compared with the existing observations from Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). For this purpose, we have created a stratospheric ozone reference dataset between June and September 2008 based on the assimilation of MLS data with the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical Observations (BASCOE). During the MLS assimilation experiment, the ozone state is saved in the space of ALTIUS previously determined with the ALTIUS orbit simulator, then perturbed according to the ALTIUS error budget, which creates ALTIUS synthetic observations. The assimilation of these ALTIUS ozone profiles agrees well with those of MLS. The assimilation of the different modes of ALTIUS reveals that all modes are necessary to constrain ozone during the polar night: solar and stellar occultations are the most constraining during the June-August period while limb scattering profiles are the most constraining from September onward.</p><div>&#160;</div>\n"}, {"paperId": "17a1aa2826be86fe2dc512f65b4c24ba7756bd02", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17a1aa2826be86fe2dc512f65b4c24ba7756bd02", "title": "The Orbiting Wide-Angle Light Collectors (OWL) Mission for Charged-Particle Astronomy", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47609938", "name": "J.

The collection of papers in this Special Feature highlights important recent advances in air-sea interaction science, emphasizing emerging priorities and critical challenges. Since the last SOLAS synthesis in 2014, the community has gained a more nuanced understanding of the variety of marine sources of atmospheric aerosols; the influence of chemical speciation on atmospheric deposition and resulting biogeochemical impacts in the ocean; the mechanistic microscale controls of aerosol production and gas exchange at the sea surface; and also how air-sea exchange processes are influencing and responding to climate change, among numerous other advances. At the same time, SOLAS scientists have engaged more directly with socio-economic networks and in the development and evaluation of environmental and policy decisions. In addition to substantial contributions to improved understanding of the global cycling of greenhouse gases, SOLAS scientists are examining the impacts of new shipping regulations and contributing to development of frameworks for climate intervention research and governance. However, challenges remain, including characterizing the variability in air-sea gas exchange, particularly in coastal regions, and identifying mechanisms by which marine emissions influence cloud dynamics and thereby coupled marine and atmospheric feedbacks to climate change. Addressing these and other challenges requires development of innovative scientific tools (e.g., chemical sensors, expanded and integrated observational networks, machine learning algorithms), and also new inter- and trans-disciplinary collaborations, to ensure that air-sea exchange research continues to transcend boundaries in tackling current and emerging global challenges."}, {"paperId": "17d3539054aa791f928b73ec443d3b4f999ae2b9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17d3539054aa791f928b73ec443d3b4f999ae2b9", "title": "On the effects of hydrocarbon and sulphur-containing compounds on the CCN activation of combustion particles", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/5/3187/2005/acp-5-3187-2005.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCSA", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/ACPD-5-2599-2005?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/ACPD-5-2599-2005, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The region features indeed a near-closed sea surrounded by very urbanised littorals and mountains from which numerous rivers originate. This results in a lot of interactions and feedbacks between oceanic\u2013atmospheric\u2013hydrological processes that play a predominant role on climate and extreme events that frequently cause heavy damages and human losses in the Mediterranean. These highimpact weather events are heavy precipitation and flash flooding during the fall season, severe cyclogenesis associated \nwith strong winds and large swell or heat waves and droughts accompanied by forest fires during summer. If during the last decade, numerical weather prediction (NWP) have made considerable progress in terms of realistic modelling of intense events, especially with the implementation \nby national weather services of convection-permitting models, they still have difficulties to predict the precipitation location and amount with the precision required to drive hydrological models, and more generally, to meet societal demands in the field of early warning and risk prevention. One of the current challenges is to quantify the uncertainties associated with these atmospheric model forecasts and to study their spread throughout the forecasting and warning chains. Also, the Mediterranean region is qualified as a \u201chot spot\u201d for climate change. However, the evolution of intense events in the Mediterranean with climate change is still an open question. Studies on the evolution of extremes with climate change rely on a cascade of models and methods; all sources of uncertainty that need to be better quantified to assess the likelihood of climate projections and of their impacts. The MEDUP project (2008\u20132011), sponsored by the French National Research Agency (ANR) Vulnerabilite Milieux et Climat \nprogram, focused on these issues. Its objectives were to quantify and reduce the uncertainties associated with NWP and regional climate models and to study how they propagate on the environment and may combine with the intrinsic uncertainties of the vulnerability and risk analysis methods. An original feature of MEDUP was to address these questions at one and the same time for weather forecasting (1\u20134 day range), seasonal forecasting (1\u20133 month range) and climate scenario simulations (50\u2013100 yr range). MEDUP was also innovative in considering the whole uncertainty chain, from the atmospheric modelling of high-impact weather events to their consequences on the environment. The region of interest was the northwestern Mediterranean in southern France, \na region with complex coast shapes and mountains. Highimpact weather events considered in MEDUP are heavy precipitation, severe winds and long dry weather periods (favouring droughts). This special issue of Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences contains 14 articles presenting most of the studies carried out within the MEDUP project. In the following, we summarize, for each of the prediction \nranges, the content and main results of the papers published in this special issue together with references to some other studies performed within MEDUP."}, {"paperId": "181a8d52a0df56ead7c11180fd39d72e21f173e0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/181a8d52a0df56ead7c11180fd39d72e21f173e0", "title": "Nutrient limitation dynamics of a coastal Cape Cod pond : seasonal trends in alkaline phosphatase activity", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/4131/1/Haupert_thesis.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

These observed features suggest the importance of nonlinear dynamics and/or stochastic forcing. Both nonlinear deterministic chaos and linear dynamics subject to stochastic forcing and/or to non\u2010normal growth were introduced to explain the irregularity of ENSO, but no consensus has been reached to date given the short observational record. As a dominant source of stochastic forcing, westerly wind bursts play a role in triggering, amplifying, and determining the irregularity and asymmetry of ENSO, which are best treated as part of the deterministic dynamics or as a multiplicative noise forcing. Various nonlinear processes are responsible for the spatial and temporal asymmetry of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which includes nonlinear ocean advection, nonlinear atmosphere\u2010ocean coupling, state\u2010dependent stochastic noise, tropical instability waves, and biophysical processes. In addition to the internal nonlinear processes, a capacitor effect of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans and atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections from extratropical Pacific could also contribute to the temporal and amplitude asymmetry of ENSO. Despite significant progress, most state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art models are still lacking in simulation of the spatial and temporal asymmetry of ENSO. 1 Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 2 Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA 3 Institute for Geophysics, Jackson School of Geosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA 4 Department of Atmospheric Sciences/IPRC, University of Hawai\u2019i at Ma \u0304noa, Honolulu, HI, USA 154 EL NI\u00d1O SOUTHERN OSCILLATION IN A CHANGING CLIMATE determine an atmosphere\u2010ocean coupled stability for ENSO system (T. Li, 1997b; An & Jin, 2000; Fedorov & Philander, 2000), and for example, depending on the coupling strength, ENSO system becomes a self\u2010sustained and possibly chaotic oscillator under a strong coupling and a damped oscillator under a weak coupling (An & Jin, 2001). It has been suggested that some decades may be characterized by a self\u2010sustained, possibly chaotic dynamics, while others show a damped ENSO cycle, excited by stochastic variability (Kirtman & Schopf, 1998). However, a bifurcation between stable and unstable regimes tends to be ambiguous in the presence of noise (e.g., Levine & Jin, 2010). Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) are episodic reversals of the equatorial trade winds with a strength of 5 to 7 ms\u20131, zonal extent of 20\u201340 degrees, duration of 5\u201330 days, and frequency of around 5 to 10 times per year (Harrison & Vecchi, 1997; L. Yu et al., 2003; Seiki & Takayabu, 2007a). These events, a dominant source of stochastic forcing, play a role in triggering, amplifying, and even determining the spatial pattern of ENSO events (Harrison & Vecchi, 1997; Eisenman et  al., 2005; Levine & Jin, 2010; Rong et al., 2011; D. Chen et al., 2015; Hayashi & Watanabe, 2017). WWBs were initially considered as additive stochastic forcing (e.g. Moore & Kleeman, 1999), yet it became clear that they depend on the background SST and tend to occur more frequently during a developing El Ni\u00f1o (Verbickas, 1998; L. Yu et al., 2003; Eisenman et al., 2005). These events are thus best treated as part of the  deterministic dynamics or as a state\u2010dependent multiplicative noise forcing, with important implications to amplitude and predictability of El Ni\u00f1o events. El Ni\u00f1o is not a simple mirror image of its opposite phase, La Ni\u00f1a. El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s amplitude is on average greater than that of La Ni\u00f1a (Deser & Wallace, 1987; Burgers & tephenson, 1999; An & Jin, 2004). El Ni\u00f1o is often followed by a La Ni\u00f1a in the following year, but the opposite is much less common (Larkin & Harrison, 2002; M. Chen et al., 2016; An & Kim, 2017). After their mature phase, many La Ni\u00f1as persist through the following year, but most of El Ni\u00f1os tend to decay rapidly by next summer (Ohba & Ueda, 2007; Okumura & Deser, 2010; Choi et al. 2013; DiNezio & Deser, 2014; An & Kim, 2018). Strong El Ni\u00f1os are mainly loaded over the eastern Pacific with focusing toward the equator, whereas strong La Ni\u00f1as are mostly loaded over the central Pacific with a wider latitudinal extension (Hoerling et al., 1997; Kang & Kug, 2002; Takahashi et  al., 2011; Dommenget et  al., 2013). Such amplitude/duration/transition/pattern asymmetries between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a may not be surprising given the nonlinear internal dynamics and/or selective external impacts (e.g., An & Kim, 2018). Asymmetrical internal nonlinear processes that are responsible for amplitude asymmetry include the vertical ocean temperature profile (Zebiak & Cane, 1986), ocean nonlinear advection (An & Jin, 2004; Su et  al. 2010), asymmetric equatorial wind response to SST (Kang & Kug, 2002; Frauen &  Dommenget, 2010; Choi et  al., 2013), ocean wave response to the wind stress (An & Kim, 2017, 2018), outcropping thermocline nonlinearity (Battisti & Hirst, 1989; Galanti et al., 2002; An & Jin, 2004), state\u2010dependent stochastic forcing (Jin et  al., 2007; Kug et  al., 2008; Rong et  al., 2011; Levine et  al., 2016; Hayashi & Watanabe, 2017), tropical instability wave activity (J. Yu & Liu, 2003; An, 2008a, 2008b), biophysical feedback (Timmermann & Jin, 2002), shortwave feedback (Lloyd et al., 2012), etc. Transition/duration asymmetry has been attributed to a selective capacitor effect of the Indian and Atlantic oceans (Ohba & Ueda, 2007; Okumura & Deser, 2010; An & Kim, 2018), development of subtropical western Pacific atmospheric circulation during decaying phase of ENSO to boost ENSO transition (B. Wang et al., 1999; B. Wang et al., 2001; Y. Li et al., 2007; B. Wu et al., 2010a), and some of aforementioned internal nonlinear processes (Choi et al., 2013; Im et al., 2015; M. Chen et al., 2016; An & Kim, 2017, 2018; M. Chen & Li, 2018). This chapter focuses on the irregularity of ENSO and on its amplitude and evolution asymmetries. In section  7.2, the origin of irregularity will be addressed together with the role of westerly wind burst events. Mechanisms for amplitude asymmetry will be discussed in section 7.3. The cause of evolution asymmetry will be reviewed in section 7.4, and we include conclusion and discussion in section 7.5."}, {"paperId": "18320336b211a327196689519ca1f36a2d848106", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18320336b211a327196689519ca1f36a2d848106", "title": "Effects of Large-Scale Urbanization on Precipitation over the Eastern China and the Uncertainty Analysis", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "104023592", "name": "J.

In the present study, the stepwise combustion analysis, performed on 13 kerogen samples, indicates that the \u03b415N values of kerogen can be sub-divided into two fractions with discrete values depending on the combustion temperatures: a lower-temperature fraction (from 500 to 575 \u030aC), and a higher-temperature fraction (higher than 575 \u030aC). A positive correlation was observed between the \u03b415N values of the lower-temperature fractions and Pr/Sm ratios, which represent contributions from the continental input. In contrast, no correlation was observed between the \u03b415N values of the higher-temperature fractions and the Pr/Sm ratios. This relationship between the \u03b415N values and the continental inputs is explained by the isotopic fractionation effects of the biological nitrogen cycle associated with the enhanced microbial activity, triggered by the active tectonic settings in the Animikie basin.

OM in sedimentary rock is considered to be a complex mixture of several organisms, however, they are poorly understood. In the stepwise combustion method, components hosted by different carriers, which are intimately mixed in a sample and cannot be separated by other physical methods, can be resolved based on the combustion temperature. A preliminary study was performed using kerogen samples extracted from two rock samples from the Gunflint Formation, indicating temperature-dependent \u03b415N heterogeneities within each kerogen sample (Ishida et al., 2012). In this study, we further examined 11 samples in search of internal \u03b415N heterogeneities in the Gunflint kerogen. The Gunflint Formation, belonging to the Animikie Group, is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada (Goodwin, 1956). The age of the Gunflint Formation is estimated as 1878 \u00b1 1.3 Ma by U-Pb dating (Fralick et al., 2002). An evolution model for the Animikie Basin has been proposed by, e.g., Schulz and Cannon (2007). The tectonic evolution in this region leads to transition from foreland-type volcanism to the back-arc type volcanism, resulting in active supply of detrital material from the continent. In the present study, samples were collected covering the variation representative of shallow to deep lithology. Lithology and whole rock major and trace element geochemistry, which were consistent with previous studies, are summarised in Supplementary Information. Stepwise Nitrogen Analysis of Kerogen The stepwise combustion method discriminates organic nitrogen fractions with different chemical natures. The analytical protocols and performances are described in Ishida et al. (2012), and references therein. Kerogen samples were combusted in an oxygen atmosphere with temperatures from 450 oC to 1100 oC. No isotope measurement was performed at 450 oC, where surficial contamination, such as adsorbed nitrogen and/or ammonium ions, dominates. Empirically two distinct nitrogen isotope plateaus appear in kerogen analyses: one appears at temperatures between 475 oC and 575 oC (lower temperature fraction: LT-fraction), and the other appears at temperatures more than 575 oC (higher temperature fraction: HT-fraction) (Ishida et al., 2012). Between 475 oC and 575 oC, combustion temperatures were increased in 25 oC steps to precisely resolve LTand HT-fractions. Beyond this temperature range, one batch of combustion was performed at 1100 oC for analyses of the HT-fraction. Besides the stepwise combustion, \u03b415N values of bulk kerogen were also determined. Geochemical Perspectives Letters Letter Geochem. Persp. Let. (2017) 4, 13-18 | doi: 10.7185/geochemlet.1729 14 Nitrogen Isotope Heterogeneity in Gunflint Kerogen The \u03b415N values of the bulk kerogen samples, ranging between +2.9 and +8.0 \u2030, are consistent with previous reports (e.g., Beaumont and Robert, 1999; Godfrey et al., 2013). The isotope shift by metamorphism can induce preferential release of 14N from the OM. However, the low metamorphic grade of the Gunflint Formation (below greenschist facies) cannot be responsible for a significant fractionation, up to 5 \u2030 (e.g., Haendal et al., 1986, Ader et al., 2016). The lack of systematic correlation between \u03b415N values and C/N ratios among kerogen samples expected by the metamorphism (e.g., Haendal et al., 1986) supports the above argument (Fig. S-3). The modern marine biosphere involves a nitrogen biological cycle that consists mainly of fixation (N2\u2192NH4), nitrification (NH4\u2192NO2\u2192NO3), and denitrification (NO3, NO2\u2192N2). When biological N2 fixation is dominant, the \u03b415N values of OM tend to be close to the atmospheric value (0 \u2030), because of minimal isotopic fractionation expected in fixation. However, when nitrification and denitrification are coupled with fixation, the \u03b415N value of OM may grow to positive values. This isotopic shift is considered as evidence of isotopic fractionation driven by biological nitrification and denitrification (e.g., Shen et al., 2006; Brandes et al., 2007; Sigman et al., 2009; Hashizume et al., 2016). The \u03b415N values of OM can vary depending on the balance between the rate of N2 fixation and the rates of nitrification/denitrification (e.g., Lehmann, et al., 2002, Pinti and Hashizume, 2011). For example, Papineau et al. (2013) reported that the \u03b415N values of OM in Palaeoproterozoic Indian sedimentary formations were approximately 0 \u2030. These values were interpreted to be the result of a system dominated by N2 fixation associated with cyanobacterial blooms. In contrast, our data show much more positive \u03b415N values for the bulk kerogen samples, reaching values as high as +8 \u2030. Such positive values suggest that nitrite and nitrate were available in the Gunflint ocean. Kerogen from Palaeoproterozoic samples, except for phosphatic shales, also exhibit positive values, up to +12 \u2030 (e.g., Beaumont and Robert, 1999; Papineau et al., 2009, Godfrey et al., 2013, St\u00fceken et al., 2016). To operate such a biological nitrogen cycle, oxygenated surface water is required at this time. Stepwise combustion analyses of \u03b415N were performed on kerogen samples mainly from the Current River section (see Supplementary Information and Table S-2). In this section, the lithology changed from shale (#0714, #0715) to carbonate-sand zone (#0711 to #0703) to arkosic sandstone (#0701, #0702). Such lithological changes represent a local marine regression. Figure 1 shows the results of the stepwise combustion analyses performed on 13 kerogen samples in our study. The average \u03b415N values of the LT-fractions and the HT-fractions (\u03b4NLT and \u03b4NHT, respectively) were calculated using the \u03b415N values and the released amounts for the relevant temperature steps. Some samples exhibited higher \u03b4NHT than \u03b4NLT, while other samples exhibited the opposite trend. The ranges of the \u03b415N values for both fractions are similar to the overall range of bulk kerogen \u03b415N values. In most samples, the HT-fractions have lower amounts of nitrogen than those of the LT-fractions. The differences in the combustion temperature possibly correspond to differences in the carbon structure for fractions of kerogen that co-exist in OM (Ishida et al., 2012). Figure 1 Results of the stepwise combustion analyses of 13 kerogen samples from the Gunflint Formation (samples #0704 and #0708 are cited from Ishida et al., 2012). Nitrogen concentrations (white bars) and \u03b415N values (black squares) are shown. The average \u03b415N values and errors of both the lower-temperature and the higher-temperature fractions are shown as light green and dark green bars, respectively.

This article presents a mature capability for running the GEOS-Chem global 3D model of atmospheric chemistry on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. GEOS-Chem users at any experience level can get immediate access to the latest, standard version of the model in a preconfigured software environment with all needed meteorological and other input data, and they can analyze model output data easily within the cloud using Python tools in Jupyter notebooks. Users with no prior knowledge of cloud computing are provided with easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions. They can learn how to complete a demo project in less than one hour, and from there they can configure and submit their own simulations. The cloud is particularly attractive for beginning and occasional users who otherwise may need to spend substantial time configuring a local computing environment. Heavy users with their own local clusters can also benefit from the cloud to access the latest standard model and datasets, share simulation configurations and results, benchmark local simulations, and respond to surges in computing demand. Software containers allow GEOS-Chem and its software environment to be moved smoothly between cloud platforms and local clusters, so that the exact same simulation can be reproduced everywhere. Because the software requirements and workflows tend to be similar across Earth science models, the work presented here provides general guidance for porting models to cloud computing platforms in a user-accessible way."}, {"paperId": "185073ca50103e2163d308725e0df83b6b34fcbf", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/185073ca50103e2163d308725e0df83b6b34fcbf", "title": "1 CLASSIFICATION : Physical Sciences-Earth , Atmospheric , and Planetary Sciences TITLE : The First Day of the Cenozoic", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "92260197", "name": "S.

The time-series photometric observations were carried out on 17 nights using a three-channel fast photometer attached to the 1.04-m optical telescope at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital. The photometric data from five nights in 2007 show a clear signature of 15-min periodicity. However, the follow-up observations during 2007-2009 did not reproduce any such periodicity. To confirm the photometric light variations, time-series spectroscopic observations were carried out with the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at La Palma on 2009 February 2. No radial velocity variations were present in this data set, which is in full agreement with the photometric observations taken around the same date. Model atmosphere and abundance analysis of HD 103498 show that the star is evolved from the main sequence and its atmospheric abundances are similar to those of two other evolved Ap stars, HD 133792 and HD 204411: large overabundances of Si, Cr and Fe and moderate overabundances of the rare-earth elements. These chemical properties and a higher effective temperature distinguish HD 103498 from any known roAp star."}, {"paperId": "18c5114c9ebcb4b1ececc2fe28f9d725bcf0f5f9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18c5114c9ebcb4b1ececc2fe28f9d725bcf0f5f9", "title": "The PACE Ocean Color Instrument (OCI): From Concept to Commissioning", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/aero63441.2025.11068421?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/aero63441.2025.11068421, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Launched on February 8, 2024, the PACE mission represents NASA's next investment in ocean biology, clouds, and aerosol data records [1]. PACE will extend the high quality ocean ecological, ocean biogeochemical, cloud, and aerosol particle data records begun by NASA in the 1990s, building on the exceptional heritages of the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of- View Sensor (Sea WiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) [2]. The PACE project office at NASA's GSFC was responsible for the satellite development, launch and operations. The NASA Headquarters PACE Program Science office is responsible for supporting the science data processing system and assembling competed community science teams, which includes field-based vicarious calibration and data product validation efforts to support the PACE Project Science team. The mission launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at 676.5 km with an inclination of 98 degrees and a 1 pm local ascending node crossing time. The PACE observatory is comprised of three instruments, an Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) and two polarimeters, the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter 2 (HARP2) and the Spectro-Polarimeter for Exploration (SPEXone). The OCI is the primary instrument on the observatory and was developed at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). It is a hyperspectral scanning radiometer designed to measure spectral radiances from the ultraviolet to shortwave infrared (SWIR) to enable advanced ocean color and heritage cloud and atmospheric aerosol science [3]\u2013[5]. NASA Headquarters directed the mission development to be guided by a Design-to-Cost (DTC) process. All elements of the mission, other than the cost, are in the DTC trade space. At the heart of the DTC process are the mission studies, performed across all the mission elements. The mission studies were used to define appropriate approaches within and across elements while maximizing science capabilities at a high cost confidence. Mission baseline requirements development is also embedded within the DTC process, as these requirements were not established at the onset of the mission concept development. Baseline mission requirements are a product of the mission studies and are defined by the project office as part of the DTC process. At the time of this writing, OCI has been commissioned as part of the PACE observatory and has begun operational science data collection. This paper provides a look into the design-to-cost trade space and how it influenced the Ocean Color Instrument development and capabilities from concept to commissioning."}, {"paperId": "18c94f78defd457d85fb1bd2430c776b944e399f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18c94f78defd457d85fb1bd2430c776b944e399f", "title": "A comparison of large-scale influences on tropical cyclogenesis in the Eastern Pacific", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "101065726", "name": "A.

Mikhail Igorevich Panasyuk graduated from the Physical Department of MSU in 1967, and, in 1972, he completed the postgraduate course. That same year, he defended his candidate thesis and in 1988, his doctoral thesis. In 1993, M I Panasyuk was conferred the academic rank of professor. Mikhail Igorevich's whole life was connected with the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics, where he worked for over 50 years, 30 of which as director. M I Panasyuk's scientific interests were concentrated on space physics, namely, ground-based and satellite experiments on space radiation, planet magnetospheres, and cosmic rays. The pioneering Earth satellite experiments carried out with the participation and guidance of M I Panasyuk yielded fundamental scientific results: the possibility of resonance acceleration of ions in Earth's radiation belts affected by quasi-periodic magnetic field fluctuations was proved and the role of radial diffusion of radiation belt particles under the action of electrostatic and magnetic field fluctuations were determined. Priority in these areas was recognized by foreign specialists. The studies, initiated by M I Panasyuk, of magnetospheric ring current responsible for geomagnetic storm generation and of the role of ionospheric oxygen as the main ring current component determining, along with solar plasma protons, geomagnetic storm energy, became widely known throughout the world. M I Panasyuk was the author of unique satellite experiments aimed at investigating anomalous cosmic rays, which led to the discovery of a new phenomenon in nearEarth space, i.e., the formation of Earth's radiation belt consisting of anomalous cosmic ray particles, and to proof of its relation to neutral interstellar gas particles. The international high-altitude balloon experiment in Antarctica for cosmic ray studies in the poorly known energy range (ATIC) was realized under the guidance of M I Panasyuk. He was one of the coordinators of work on the now developed TAIGA project\u00d0 the international astrophysical observatory near Lake Baikal\u00d0aimed at high-energy cosmic ray and gamma-ray quantum research. M I Panasyuk initiated and developed (with his colleagues) numerous satellite-based space experiments that underlay the space research programs at LomonosovMSU.Among them are the Tatyana-1 (2005) and Tatyana-2 (2009) satellites, which yielded results on extreme phenomena in Earth's atmosphere\u00d0transient electric discharges in its upper layers. Under his guidance, space experiments were carried out aboard the Vernov satellite (2014) to examine the effect of space radiation on the upper atmospheric layers and to study the dynamics of Earth's radiation belts, as well as the Nuklon experiment for investigating the chemical composition of galactic cosmic rays. M I Panasyuk was research supervisor of experiments aboard a unique astrophysical laboratory\u00d0 the Russian university satellite Lomonosov (2016). In addition to fundamental space research, M I Panasyuk supervised scientific and applied experiments on space radiation monitoring aboard Russian meteorological satellites in the Meteor, Elektro, Glonass, and Kosmos series and the International Space Station. For his scientific studies, M I Panasyuk was awarded the Prize of the USSRMinistry of Higher and Secondary Special Education (1985) and the M V Lomonosov Prize (1999). He was recognized for excellence (1987) and as an honored worker in higher education in Russia (2005). M I Panasyuk taught in the Physical Department at MSU.

Climate change and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly linked sciences, with AI already showing capability in identifying early precursors to extreme weather events. There are many AI methods, and a selection of the most appropriate maximizes additional understanding extractable for any dataset. However, most AI algorithms are statistically based, so even with careful splitting between data for training and testing, they arguably remain emulators. Emulators may make unreliable predictions when driven by out-of-sample forcing, of which climate change is an example, requiring understanding responses to atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations potentially much higher than for the present or recent past. The emerging AI technique of \u201cequation discovery\u201d also does not automatically guarantee good performance for new forcing regimes. However, equations rather than statistical emulators guide better system understanding, as more interpretable variables and parameters may yield informed judgements as to whether models are trusted under extrapolation. Furthermore, for many climate system attributes, descriptive equations are not yet fully available or may be unreliable, hindering the important development of Earth system models (ESMs), which remain the main tool for projecting environmental change as GHGs rise. Here, we argue for AI-driven equation discovery in climate research, given that its outputs are more amenable to linking to processes. As the foundation of ESMs is the numerical discretization of equations that describe climate components, equation discovery from datasets provides a format capable of direct inclusion into such models where system component representation is poor. We present three illustrative examples of how AI-led equation discovery may help generate new equations related to atmospheric convection, parameter derivation for existing equations of the terrestrial carbon cycle, and (additional to ESM improvement) the creation of simplified models of large-scale oceanic features to assess tipping point risks.\n"}, {"paperId": "1934f914d8e617010b889787d65b4edb1664100b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1934f914d8e617010b889787d65b4edb1664100b", "title": "Atmospheric Neutrinos as a Tool for Exploring the Earth\u2019s Inner Parts", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Understanding its degree of plasticity to various abiotic factors is therefore important. We conducted a meta-analysis of a wide range of experiments in which plants were grown under different levels of CO2, light, temperature, and water availability, and derived generalized dose-response curves. Although both stomatal density and stomatal index showed a significant negative correlation with CO2\u00a0levels, these relationships were weak and only marginally consistent across the analyzed experiments. In contrast, the effect of growth light intensity was positive, highly consistent, and substantially stronger than the impact of atmospheric CO2. Temperature also positively influenced stomatal density, while water availability showed no consistent effects. Based on these dose-response curves, we highlight several caveats when using stomatal density or stomatal index for paleo-CO2\u00a0reconstruction. The weak CO2\u00a0response, coupled with the strong confounding impact of light intensity, poses significant limitations to the accuracy of such estimates."}, {"paperId": "196c0a0d8fb9b59fb46db5eca70d9311756917ba", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/196c0a0d8fb9b59fb46db5eca70d9311756917ba", "title": "Chapter 4 Satellites See the World\u2019s Atmosphere", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "108472247", "name": "A.

Burns"}], "abstract": "The possible detection of ancient life in martian meteorite ALH84001 (D. S. McKay et al ., Research Article, [16 Aug., p. 924][1]) raises questions about the likelihood that microorganisms might have been transported between Earth and Mars ([1][2]). A related question is whether martian samples (to be returned by future spacecraft missions) should be sterilized in order to protect Earth from possible contamination. The survivability of such organisms on their journey between planetary habitats would depend on the flight time, which determines the dose of damaging cosmic rays and ultraviolet radiation, and the sample size, which might protect a meteorite's interior from radiation and from the heat of atmospheric entry.\n\nIn an attempt to understand the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of the dozen known martian meteorites, we numerically simulated the orbital histories of more than 2000 particles launched from Mars at speeds slightly above escape (B. J. Gladman et al ., Research Article, [8 Mar., p. 1387][3]); these particles were followed as their orbits evolved as a result of close planetary encounters and distant perturbations of all the planets from Venus to Neptune. In our simulation, we found that a few percent of the martian particles struck Earth, having typical transfer times of several million years; ALH84001's measured transfer age of about 15 million years is unusually long.\n\nAlthough terrestrial bacteria are known to have survived in vacuum for several years ([2][4]), transit times of millions of years may preclude safe passage. Our simulations show, however, that a small fraction of martian ejecta launched just marginally faster than the martian escape speed could be found immediately on Earth-crossing orbits. Our simulations show that the rate of Earth deliveries was almost constant for the first 107 years, which implies that on the order of 1 in 107 of the martian meteorites that reached Earth could have spent less than half of an orbital period in space (less than a year). The dozen recovered martian meteorites, the majority of which have been on Earth for much less than 105 years, represent only a tiny fraction of all the pieces of Mars currently on our planet and, when one considers the much higher impact rate early in the solar system's history, an even smaller proportion of those that have arrived throughout Earth's history. Therefore, fast transfers (taking less than a year) from Mars to Earth must have occurred numerous times during Earth's past. We leave to others an appraisal of the likelihood of survival of martian organisms in the rigors of space and their fiery entry through Earth's atmosphere. Because such an entry would hardly affect the center of a meteorite, terrestrial weathering would eventually have exposed the pristine interior. If martian microorganisms can survive a year in space, many may have already arrived.\n\nLarge impact events could also have liberated some pieces of Earth at high speeds and simultaneously could have cleared an atmospheric channel through which a few particles might have slipped to Mars. Our simulations show that about 0.1% of these rarely liberated terrene meteoroids could have found their way to Mars, but even fewer than 1 in 107 of these would have had rapid transfer times.\n\n1. 1.[\u21b5][5] 1.

The ways in which terrestrial net primary production responds to elevated CO2 and associated climate change is a key topic of climate sciences. This study estimated the responses of net primary production to quadrupled CO2 using 23 Earth system models, and analyzed the underlying causes of uncertainties among the models. The results showed that all of the models projected positive responses of net primary production, with an averaged magnitude of 44.78 PgC year\u22121 and an uncertainty of \u00b120.93 PgC year\u22121. The uncertainty came from many sources, and this study emphasizes the role of different projections in CO2-induced climatic anomalies and different climate sensitivities. These results provide a reliable estimation of global net primary production response to quadrupled CO2, and point out that more understanding and improvements are needed for Earth system models to represent both physical climatic processes and the terrestrial carbon cycle. Abstract Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) is a key carbon flux that changes with rising atmospheric CO2 and CO2-induced climate change. Earth system models are commonly used to investigate these NPP changes because of their fundamentally trustworthy ability to simulate physical climate systems and terrestrial biogeochemical processes. However, many uncertainties remain in projecting NPP responses, due to their complex processes and divergent model characteristics. This study estimated NPP responses to elevated CO2 and CO2-induced climate change using the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model version 2 (CAS-ESM2), as well as 22 CMIP6 models. Based on CMIP6 pre-industrial and abruptly quadrupled CO2 experiments, the analysis focused on a comparison of the CAS-ESM2 with the multi-model ensemble (MME), and on a detection of underlying causes of their differences. We found that all of the models showed an overall enhancement in NPP, and that CAS-ESM2 projected a slightly weaker NPP enhancement than MME. This weaker NPP enhancement was the net result of much weaker NPP enhancement over the tropics, and a little stronger NPP enhancement over northern high latitudes. We further report that these differences in NPP responses between the CAS-ESM2 and MME resulted from their different behaviors in simulating NPP trends with modeling time, and are attributed to their different projections of CO2-induced climatic anomalies and different climate sensitivities. These results are favorable for understanding and further improving the performance of the CAS-ESM2 in projecting the terrestrial carbon cycle, and point towards a need for greater understanding and improvements for both physical climatic processes and the terrestrial carbon cycle."}, {"paperId": "19ca21987543868fd0e3b9d1a75d0f3632212236", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19ca21987543868fd0e3b9d1a75d0f3632212236", "title": "Integrated remote sensing of the earth from low earth orbit in the 1990's", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102730115", "name": "D.

The use of CubeSat to demonstrate earth imaging capability has also grown in the last two decades. In 2017, a South African company known as Space Commercial Services launched a low-orbit nanosatellite named nSight-1. The demonstration nanosatellite has three payloads that include a modular designed SCS Gecko imaging payload, FIPEX atmospheric science instrument developed by the University of Dresden and a Radiation mitigation VHDL coding experiment supplied by Nelson Mandela University. The Gecko imager has a swath width of 64 km and captures 30 m spatial resolution images using the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectral bands. The objective of this study was to assess the interpretability of nSight-1 in the spatial dimension using Landsat 8 as a reference and to recommend potential earth observation applications for the mission. A blind image spatial quality evaluator known as Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) was used to compute the image quality for nSight-1 and Landsat 8 imagery in the spatial domain and the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) method to quantify the interpretability of the images. A visual interpretation was used to propose some potential applications for the nSight1 images. The results indicate that Landsat 8 OLI images had significantly higher image quality scores and NIIRS results compared to nSight-1. Landsat 8 has a mean of 19.299 for the image quality score while nSight-1 achieved a mean of 25.873. Landsat 8 had NIIRS mean of 2.345 while nSight-1 had a mean of 1.622. The superior image quality and image interpretability of Landsat could be attributed for the mature optical design on the Landsat 8 satellite that is aimed for operational purposes. Landsat 8 has a GDS of 30-m compared to 32-m on nSight-1. The image degradation resulting from the lossy compression implemented on nSight-1 from 12-bit to 8-bit also has a negative impact on image visual quality and interpretability. Whereas it is evident that Landsat 8 has the better visual quality and NIIRS scores, the results also showed that nSight-1 are still very good if one considers that the categorical ratings consider that images to be of good to excellent quality and a NIIRS mean of 1.6 indicates that the images are interpretable. Our interpretation of the imagery shows that the data has considerable potential for use in geo-visualization and cartographic land use and land cover mapping applications. The image analysis also showed the capability of the nSight-1 sensor to capture features related to structural geology, geomorphology and topography quite prominently."}, {"paperId": "19d6def5343f4e40e8cbe5a8b655d6398d9e6055", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19d6def5343f4e40e8cbe5a8b655d6398d9e6055", "title": "Water vapor estimates using simultaneous S and Ka Band radar measurements", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "123768110", "name": "E.

The EMI instrument onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite was launched on 9 May 2018. In this paper, we present the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column density (VCD) retrieval algorithm dedicated to EMI measurement. We report the first successful retrieval of tropospheric NO2 VCD from the EMI instrument. Our retrieval improved the original EMI NO2 prototype algorithm by modifying the settings of the spectral fit and air mass factor calculations to account for the on-orbit instrumental performance changes. The retrieved EMI NO2 VCDs generally show good spatiotemporal agreement with the satellite-borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (correlation coefficient R of ~0.9, bias <\u200950%). A comparison with ground-based MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) observations also shows good correlation with an R of 0.82. The results indicate that the EMI NO2 retrieval algorithm derives reliable and precise results, and this algorithm can feasibly produce stable operational products that can contribute to global air pollution monitoring. Improvements to a high-resolution spectrometer onboard China\u2019s recently-launched GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite can give researchers a new tool to assess atmospheric trace gases. Cheng Liu from the University of Science and Technology of China and his colleagues reported the first successful retrieval of nitrogen dioxide from the GF-5 orbiter thanks to crucial adjustments to calibration algorithms. The satellite\u2019s payload Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) uses visible spectroscopic measurements to detect nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere, which can be used to identify the spatial distribution of pollution emissions on the Earth. To overcome on-orbit issues including detector saturation, the team has optimized the spectral retrieval settings by spectral precalibration, fitting wavelength adjustment, reference spectrum selection, etc. Comparisons to other satellite and ground measurements revealed the optimization effort yielded reliable results for monitoring pollution levels."}, {"paperId": "19f9f33ca826d5ffc58d2f78126be8e8782bea94", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19f9f33ca826d5ffc58d2f78126be8e8782bea94", "title": "The Walker & Syers model and the age of soil", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42832-022-0170-2.pdf", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Although Proxima Cen b orbits within its star's habitable zone, multiple plausible evolutionary paths could have generated different environments that may or may not be habitable. Here, we use 1-D coupled climate-photochemical models to generate self-consistent atmospheres for several evolutionary scenarios, including high-O2, high-CO2, and more Earth-like atmospheres, with both oxic and anoxic compositions. We show that these modeled environments can be habitable or uninhabitable at Proxima Cen b's position in the habitable zone. We use radiative transfer models to generate synthetic spectra and thermal phase curves for these simulated environments, and use instrument models to explore our ability to discriminate between possible planetary states. These results are applicable not only to Proxima Cen b but to other terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. Thermal phase curves may provide the first constraint on the existence of an atmosphere. We find that James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations longward of 10\u2009\u03bcm could characterize atmospheric heat transport and molecular composition. Detection of ocean glint is unlikely with JWST but may be within the reach of larger-aperture telescopes. Direct imaging spectra may detect O4 absorption, which is diagnostic of massive water loss and O2 retention, rather than a photosynthetic biosphere. Similarly, strong CO2 and CO bands at wavelengths shortward of 2.5\u2009\u03bcm would indicate a CO2-dominated atmosphere. If the planet is habitable and volatile-rich, direct imaging will be the best means of detecting habitability. Earth-like planets with microbial biospheres may be identified by the presence of CH4\u2014which has a longer atmospheric lifetime under Proxima Centauri's incident UV\u2014and either photosynthetically produced O2 or a hydrocarbon haze layer.

Schultz"}], "abstract": "Introduction: Geosciences are utilising big data that is constantly updated, modified, and changed with an ever-growing stream of new measured, modelled accumulated data (Reichstein et al. 2019). Many of these data reside in databases and are frequently revised and recalculated with new data, corrections, or recalibrations. Thus, versioning the data is a known challenge for the earth sciences system (ESS) community. To ensure reusability of the data and traceability of associated information, it is crucial to document this stream of changes in an efficient, human-readable, and machine-actionable manner. As previous studies (lump et al. 2021, Schultes et al. 2022) and community driven-efforts have shown, we believe the FAIR Digital Object (FDO) (De Smedt et al. 2020) concept could provide a neat solution by encapsulating the data, metadata, data version, and associated information and identifying it with a persistent identifier (PID) (Philipson 2019). In addition, FDO could be a path to avoid rerunning expensive, energy-demanding computations and data duplication as PID and metadata could enable a detailed search and cataloguing of available statistical aggregations and other products. In this conceptual work, we want to explore the FDO capability for data versioning combined with a state-of-the-art caching system for relational databases to provide reusable and mutable data products. Such an FDO-enabled caching system would enable us to identify recurring access patterns to data and store them as FDOs. Moreover, we believe such a concept could be integrated into an automated workflow where highly anticipated computation or user requests that require intensive computation are generated and submitted to High-performance Computing (HPC)'s.\n Case study: TOAR database: The Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) database (Schultz 2017) consists of an extensive collection of global air quality measurements focusing on ground-level ozone. We use a PostgreSQL (PostgresSQL 2022) database, a widely used database for relational data, and provide the database schema and all related code via a free and open-source git repository (J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre 2022). A vital asset of the TOAR database is the associated REST API which has been implemented with Python/fast API and includes a module for statistical analysis of TOAR data. Users can request one or several of over 30 different statistical aggregates and define one of 5 target temporal resolutions from daily to annual, and the API will trigger online calculations based on the original data, which are stored at hourly time resolution. As there is an apparent demand from the scientific community to expand these analysis capabilities and allow for multi-variable and multi-station analysis (for example, to evaluate numerical model simulations), it will be necessary to design new parallel workflows to enable such calculations in a reasonable time.\n Two specific challenges to overcome in the design of automated workflow with an FDO-enabled caching system are ensuring that the query stays connected to the correct data and establishing a schedule for pre-calculating the most frequently used statistical aggregates. In the following, we discuss these two challenges in more detail. \n Caching system: There are other data providers in the field, but they commonly focus mainly on archiving the measurement data. We want an analysis tool with the fastest possible response times for the users. Furthermore, we want to look into FDOs to ensure the preservation of queries and make them reusable and traceable. For the caching itself, it is very important that the cache key created for a query allows for verification that the data used in computing the query the first time did not change when trying to reuse the cached result. In our conceptual work, we want to develop a concept and a demonstrator of an atmospheric data analysis cache. This includes choices for the underlying technical solution (e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis...), the definition of data structures and hash codes, design of a mechanism for the triggering of re-calculations, definition of a schedule for automated cache updates, and various aspects related to query documentation and reproducibility of results. Technical obstacles caused by the expected size of up to 0.8 Terabytes for the TOAR and complicated scalability issues that can arise should be considered for a possible solution. Ideally, the caching system should be agnostic of the underlying database/server choice to enhance portability. \n Automated workflow: The second challenge to address here is to combine the envisioned caching system with a flexible workflow scheme. Such a workflow setup enables preparing pre-compile and calculating the most frequently used statistical aggregate ahead of user demand. Queries can either be triggered by a user (demand-driven) or by an automatic system which will compute commonly used queries without a user having to trigger it (provider-driven) to have as many query results as possible ready to go for users, so they do not have to wait for the results after they have sent a request. User requests are categorised according to the availability of the statistical products and the required computation effort. Some might have already been calculated and stored as FDO can be quickly reloaded and processed further. While some queries might be new, but still possible to be calculated on the fly, and the responses could be delivered on near real-time basis. In contrast, some more intensive statistical aggregations require HPC. We believe an automated FDO-enabled caching system will utilise the metadata and FDO to provide on-demand data requests and reduce repetitive computation. It paves the way for intelligent computation that can be scheduled at different times of the day based on the priority and availability of resources, and reduction of the energy consumption and carbon footprint of computing.\n Outlook and next steps: In our conceptual work and demonstrator, we aim not to use the FDO only to ensure long-term preservation but rather to create a use case where FDO is used for practical reusability in the daily operation of the database. An automated FDO-enabled caching system requires multiple components to work synchronously. In the following months, we will focus on creating a demonstrator for the caching system, adopting an FDO typing that could fit the best with the planned tasks, and creating a workflow management system that could support such a dynamic system with interfaces to API-enabled web-services, cloud computing resources and conventional HPC resources."}, {"paperId": "1a8d8749c49b1df594098c30578f28e42a1067ca", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a8d8749c49b1df594098c30578f28e42a1067ca", "title": "Trajectory Coupled Aerothermodynamics Modeling for Atmospheric Entry Probes at Hypersonic Velocities", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

The large number of spatially distributed earth observation products, i.e. time series of surface emissions and reflectances at different wavelengths with increasing spatial resolution, contribute to the derivation of surface characteristics, e.g. vegetation or soil parameters in the environmental sciences. These derivatives usually build upon complex algorithms consisting of atmospheric corrections and process descriptions. The testing scheme presented here seeks a different approach to identifying these surface characteristics that control the generation of such observation time series. Spatially distributed patterns of these characteristics of different persistence usually dominate parts of a time series because of their very specific reaction to and interaction with environmental influences. We test these characteristics' patterns for their existence in a rotated vector space of elementary patterns derived from a principal component analysis of an observational time series. With the result of this test we can then make valid assumptions, e.g. with regard to the importance of the surface properties for the emittance or reflectance, or their spatial uncertainties. We demonstrate the functionality of this rather simple test algorithm for a synthetic and fully traceable example, and an application in a medium hydrological catchment for a time series of thermal satellite data. Possible future applications for this scheme are the prioritization and improvement of model input, data assimilation, or the evaluation and validation of model output."}, {"paperId": "1ab22b7ea4cbd3537ff46a7b5270643fdc9c121b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ab22b7ea4cbd3537ff46a7b5270643fdc9c121b", "title": "Vicarious Radiometric Calibration of the Multispectral Imager Onboard SDGSAT-1 over the Dunhuang Calibration Site, China", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/10/2578/pdf?version=1684303393", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs15102578?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15102578, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

SDGSAT-1 was launched at 2:19 UTC on 5 November 2021, as the world\u2019s first Earth science satellite to serve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. A vicarious radiometric calibration experiment was conducted at the Dunhuang calibration site (Gobi Desert, China) on 14 December 2021. In-situ measurements of ground reflectance, aerosol optical depth (AOD), total columnar water vapor, radiosonde data, and diffuse-to-global irradiance (DG) ratio were performed to predict the top-of-atmosphere radiance by the reflectance-, irradiance-, and improved irradiance-based methods using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission model. The MII calibration coefficients were calculated by dividing the top-of-atmosphere radiance by the average digital number value of the image. The radiometric calibration coefficients calculated by the three calibration methods were reliable (average relative differences: 2.20% (reflectance-based vs. irradiance-based method) and 1.43% (reflectance-based vs. improved irradiance-based method)). The total calibration uncertainties of the reflectance-, irradiance-, and improved irradiance-based methods were 2.77\u20135.23%, 3.62\u20135.79%, and 3.50\u20135.23%, respectively. The extra DG ratio measurements in the latter two methods did not improve the calibration accuracy for AODs \u2264 0.1. The calibrated MII images were verified using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images. The retrieved ground reflectances of the MII over different surface types were cross-compared with those of OLI and MSI using the FAST Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes software. The MII retrievals differed by <0.0075 (7.13%) from OLI retrievals and <0.0084 (7.47%) from MSI retrievals for calibration coefficients from the reflectance-based method; <0.0089 (7.57%) from OLI retrievals and <0.0111 (8.65%) from MSI retrievals for the irradiance-based method; and <0.0082 (7.33%) from OLI retrievals and <0.0101 (8.59%) from MSI retrievals for the improved irradiance-based method.

Also, while overall coal reserves in India are extremely large (more than 308 billion tonnes and comprising of 7% global reserves), the recoverable reserves are just over 60 billion tonnes [1]. Innovative coal mining technologies thus have to play an important role in ensuring that the recovery and utilization of coal improves in light of energy security for the country. For instance, it is reported that highwall mining technology has resulted in recovery of more than 25 lakh tonne of locked-up coal from three opencast mines [2]. It is here that the role of underground coal gasification (UCG) technology also becomes relevant. The technology has the potential to serve many of India\u2019s energy objectives i.e. increase of indigenous natural gas supply, extraction of energy from deep seated coal, reduction of fugitive methane emissions due to conventional coal mining and reduction in atmospheric emissions during power generation. This route may also ease the future into a hydrogen economy. In 1984, I had the privilege of chairing a steering group on UCG in India. Subsequently, several other organizations (ONGC, Coal India, CSIR Laboratories and IITs) have performed considerable work in this area. As a result, a significant repository of geological characteristics, economic feasibility and mathematical models have been established within the country. While considerable work has been done in this area, many challenges remain for the commercialization of this technology \u2013 something that can be achieved through greater industry-academia collaboration. More than 25 years ago, I wrote, \u201cThe engineering challenges in exploiting our huge reserves of unmineable coals in north Gujarat (estimated at more than 60 billion tons), at a depth of 1000 m and more, are enormous and we can be world leaders\u201d [3]. The same stands true for today as well and I am hopeful that this target may be realized to pave way for a sustainable future. In fact, the conditions in India are far more compelling and propitious than anywhere in the world and we may well find a great opportunity to become global leaders in UCG at depth of 1000 m and more. I am happy to note that scientists at the CSIR-Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research have been engaged in a 12th Five Year Plan Project on Underground Coal Gasification. As part of this project and with an effort to reach out to industry personnel, they organized a two-day workshop on \u201cChallenges and Opportunities of Underground Coal Gasification in India\u201d. The results of this workshop are expected to be well-documented in the IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science. I am happy to note that the papers are a mix of industrial learning, lab-level experimentation and modelling, along with rigorous policy analysis. I commend the organizers for this timely initiative and hope that this leads to positive changes for this technology.

Indian Inst. Sci. 71 457-473 Preface Coal is the mainstay of India\u2019s energy sector and is likely to shape India\u2019s energy future. With the Paris Climate Agreement, coupled with the Government of India\u2019s thrust on clean energy sources, it is imperative for us to deploy clean coal technologies with lesser environmental impacts. It should be ensured that such sources are offered at the lowest possible cost to ensure energy affordability to the lower strata of the society. While India has abundant coal reserves, much of the coal remains unmineable due to complex geo-mining conditions, mine hazards and economic complexities. If we are to continue using coal sustainably, different variants of utilizing energy from coal also need to be identified. Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is one such technology. While the Government of India has shown significant support for this technology, that coupled with enthusiasm from the Industry has not translated into commercial utilization. With an aim to further the cause of UCG in India, we undertook the Project CoalGasUrja (Development of Underground Coal Gasification Technology in India) as a CSIR Network Project under the Twelfth Five Year Plan. The project \u2013 which is now on the verge of completion \u2013 has resulted in significant outcomes for UCG in India in terms of coal characterization, reactivity studies, thermo-fluid modelling, site selection criteria and cost estimation. The final and perhaps the most crucial part of the project is knowledge dissemination to the industries. With this objective, a two-day workshop on Challenges and Opportunities of Underground Coal Gasification in India (UCG-2017) was organized during 13-14 February, 2017 at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi. It is a matter of immense pleasure for us that IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Sciences is publishing the papers presented at the workshop. I am hopeful that this volume serves as a bridge for the next generation of scientists and engineers to carry out the work that we have left incomplete. The papers in this volume are a combination of policy, technical and industrial field experience. I thank all the authors who have contributed to this volume. I thank our Director, Dr. Pradeep K Singh, Chairman, Organizing Committee and Dr. Rajendra Singh, Head of the Research Group for their guidance and personal support.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) performs these observations from the ground, and its main imaging targets are SagittariusA* in the Galactic Center and the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy. However, the EHT is fundamentally limited in its performance by atmospheric effects and sparse terrestrial (u, v)-coverage (Fourier sampling of the image). The scientific interest in quantitative studies of the horizon size and shape of these black holes has motivated studies into using space interferometry which is free of these limitations. Angular resolution considerations and interstellar scattering effects push the desired observing frequency to bands above 500GHz. This paper presents the requirements for meeting these science goals, describes the concept of interferometry from Polar or Equatorial Medium Earth Orbits (PECMEO) which we dub the Event Horizon Imager (EHI), and utilizes suitable space technology heritage. In this concept, two or three satellites orbit at slightly different orbital radii, resulting in a dense and uniform spiral-shaped (u, v)-coverage over time. The local oscillator signals are shared via an inter-satellite link, and the data streams are correlated on-board before final processing on the ground. Inter-satellite metrology and satellite positioning are extensively employed to facilitate the knowledge of the instrument position vector, and its time derivative. The European space heritage usable for both the front ends and the antenna technology of such an instrument is investigated. Current and future sensors for the required inter-satellite metrology are listed.

A water quality monitoring model was developed using Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data set to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of water quality indicators at Koka Reservoir. L1C images were processed with an Atmospheric correction processor ACOLITE. The months from June 2021 to May 2022 and the years 2017 to 2022 were used for the temporal analyses. Algorithms were developed by using regression analysis and developing empirical models by correlating satellite reflectance data with in situ Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), turbidity (TU), and Total suspended matter (TSS) measurements. All of the analyzed parameters have determination coefficients (R2) greater than 0.67, indicating that they can be turned into predictive models. R2 for the developed algorithms were 0.91, 0.92, and 0.67, indicating that good correlations have been found between field-based and estimated Chl-a, TU, and TSS, respectively. Accordingly, the mean monthly Chl-a, TU, and TSS levels have ranged from (59.69 to 144.25 g/L), (79.67 to 115.39 NTU), and (38.46 to 368.97 mg/L), respectively. The annual mean Chl-a, TU, and TSS vary from (52.86\u201396.19 \u00b5g/L), (71.04\u201383 NTU), and (36.58\u2013159.26 mg/L), respectively, showing that the reservoir has been continuously polluted over the last seven years. The spatial study found that the distributions of Chl-a, TU, and TSS were heterogeneous, with Chl-a being greater in the south and southwest, and TU and TSS being higher on the western shore of the reservoir. In conclusion, these results show that there are spatial as well as temporal variations on water quality parameters. The proposed algorithms are capable of detecting optically active water quality indicators and can be applied in similar environmental situations."}, {"paperId": "1b1164f03e2bd80a0460f2f290a201b4967905d7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b1164f03e2bd80a0460f2f290a201b4967905d7", "title": "Controlled environment chamber system for gas exchange measurements: setup and operating principles", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88692777", "name": "M.

Based on data collected by balloons and satellites since the 1980s, evidence suggests that Earth's atmosphere is composed of complex molecules such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with polar bent molecular structures, similar to water (H2O). Although nitrogen-oxygen mixing ratios have been recorded for over 50 years, they have often been overlooked in studies of redox reactions, biological systems, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Microorganisms, including bacteria in oceans and soils, release nitrous oxides, NO2, NO, and N2O, which are abundant in these environments. Nitric oxide (NO) is also among the most prevalent molecules in biological systems; experiments indicate that NO2 and NO diffuse rapidly across cell membranes. Measurements at altitudes of 10-12 km show a ratio of 1 NO to 2-6 times NO2, with air density estimates indicating 300-400% more NO2 compared to NO at the surface. Near the surface, the ratio is approximately 2:1 NO, similar to the historically accepted 78% nitrogen measurements. This data suggests that the air density of NO2 is less than 2.05257 g/L or kg/m3, which is about 68% heavier than the standard air density of 1.19 g/L.

Uncertainties about changes in atmospheric aerosol particle sources and abundance over time translate to uncertainties in their impact on Earth's climate and their response to changes in air quality policy. One limitation in our understanding of organic aerosol has been a lack of comprehensive measurements of its molecular composition and volatility, which can elucidate sources and processes affecting its abundance. Herein we describe advances in the development and application of the Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols (FIGAERO) coupled to field-deployable High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometers (HRToF-CIMS). The FIGAERO HRToFCIMS combination broadly probes gas and particulate OA molecular composition by using programmed thermal desorption of particles collected on a Teflon filter with subsequent detection and speciation of desorbed vapors using inherently quantitative selected-ion chemical ionization. The thermal desorption provides a means to obtain quantitative insights into the volatility of particle components and thus the physicochemical nature of the organic material that will govern its evolution in the atmosphere.In this Account, we discuss the design and operation of the FIGAERO, when coupled to the HRToF-CIMS, for quantitative characterization of the molecular-level composition and effective volatility of organic aerosol in the laboratory and field. We provide example insights gleaned from its deployment, which improve our understanding of organic aerosol sources and evolution. Specifically, we connect thermal desorption profiles to the effective equilibrium saturation vapor concentration and enthalpy of vaporization of detected components. We also show how application of the FIGAERO HRToF-CIMS to environmental simulation chamber experiments and the field provide new insights and constraints on the chemical mechanisms governing secondary organic aerosol formation and dynamic evolution. We discuss the associated challenges of thermal decomposition during desorption and calibration of both the volatility axis and signal. We also illustrate how the FIGAERO HRToF-CIMS can provide additional insights into organic aerosol through isothermal evaporation experiments as well as for detection of ultrafine particulate composition. We conclude with a description of future opportunities and needs for its ability to further organic aerosol science."}, {"paperId": "1b786b5deb21225c3ce6be9614df5eadc3a5b542", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b786b5deb21225c3ce6be9614df5eadc3a5b542", "title": "Simulation of the initial phase of Holuhraun eruption using the ICON-ART model to investigate aerosol- cloud interaction\u00a0", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13446?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13446, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For this purpose, the Holuhraun volcano, which erupted on the island of Iceland in 2014, was simulated. It emitted small amounts of volcanic ash, and large emissions of gases primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2), which formed sulfate particles serving as CCN. Three simulations representing low, control, and high emission conditions were conducted. For the control simulation, the source strength of SO2 was based on the estimate by Malavelle et al. (2017). This rate, then, was reduced to one-fifth for the low emission experiment and increased by a factor of 5 for the high emission experiment.</p><p>First results indicate that increasing the source strength of SO2 is associated with an enhancement of sulfate aerosol number concentration and thus an increase of the number of cloud droplets, but with strongly nonlinear effects. For clouds within the volcanic plume, droplet concentrations are already high in the low emission scenario and do not increase significantly with higher emission strengths, partly due to model limitations. In addition, the effect of aerosols on the formation of cloud droplets is strongly dependent on environmental factors such as updraft velocity and supersaturation.</p><p>Keywords: Aerosol, Cloud, ICON-ART Model, Holuhraun eruption</p>"}, {"paperId": "1b79f5d00ced1c8d5c3da3ff4231941b2bbc6428", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b79f5d00ced1c8d5c3da3ff4231941b2bbc6428", "title": "Teaching Systems Principles and Policy Applications Using a Reduced-Scale Carbon Cycle Model for Global Warming", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://nagt.org/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/crawfordbrownv54p301.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {'abstract'}.

Economic growth and food security in this region is therefore highly dependent on the knowledge of rainfall patterns. According to the IPCC, the Global South will seriously suffer from climate change. As traditional rainfall patterns shift, accurate rainfall information becomes crucial for farmers to optimize food production.</p><p>The scarce rain gauge distribution and data transmission challenges make rainfall analysis difficult in these regions. Satellites could offer a solution to this problem, but present satellite products do not account for local characteristics and perform poorly in West Africa. For example, comparing the widely used TAMSAT and CHIRPS satellite rainfall products with ground data in our pilot area in the Northern Region of Ghana, we found a very poor correlation with TAMSAT and CHIRPS grossly overestimating the number of rainy days, while underestimating the amount of rainfall per event.</p><p>The RainRunner rainfall retrieval algorithm, developed within the Schools and Satellites (SaS) project, aims to overcome the lack of ground data and good rainfall satellite products through Earth Observation and advanced Machine Learning (ML). SaS is being funded by the European Space Agency as one of the pilot projects of CSEOL (Citizen Science and Earth Observation Lab). It is being developed in a cooperation between TU Delft, PULSAQUA, TAHMO Ghana, Smartphones4Water and the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet).</p><p>Research suggests that local characteristics are the reason for traditional rainfall retrieval algorithms to perform poorly in West Africa, where the land surface temperature and the concentration of atmospheric aerosols are higher than in other regions in the world. Hence, RainRunner will utilize information relevant to the rain process other than the traditionally used cloud top temperature, namely, cloud amount, atmospheric aerosols, soil moisture and land surface temperature. These data are derived from diverse sensors onboard ESA&#8217;s Sentinel satellites (S1, S2, S3 and S5P), as well as MSG&#8217;s Aviris. The satellite products, together with a Digital Elevation Model, will be pre-processed into datacubes to be fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate precipitation for a certain geographic point.</p><p>CNNs have shown to achieve better results when modelling complex natural processes than other ML algorithms, when provided with big amounts of data and well-designed architectures that represent the physical process knowledge. Furthermore, they have the main advantages of computing efficiency and the ability to represent processes beyond numerical simulations. The latter is essential for understanding the complex interactions between variables, therefore resulting in not only improving rainfall estimates but also in increasing our understanding of processes in poorly measured regions.</p><p>The Proof-of-Concept algorithm will be trained and validated with TAHMO and GMet ground measurements. Eventually, the training and validation dataset will incorporate data acquired by a rainfall observation network combining low-cost sensors and Citizen Science data collected by schoolchildren in Ghana.</p><p>Once operative, the RainRunner will guide agricultural extension agents, support crop insurance and ultimately contribute to economic growth and food security in the Global South.</p>\n"}, {"paperId": "1b92d0b6658b09c084f4ad7150fb6918564ec792", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b92d0b6658b09c084f4ad7150fb6918564ec792", "title": "Governing Earth \u2019 s Temperature : Principal Control Knob 2 Atmospheric CO", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2045617", "name": "A.
