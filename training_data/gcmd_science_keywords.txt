The cumuliform cloud elements generally have a common base and usually seem to be arranged in lines. The species is found only in the genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Cirrus castellanus differs from cirrocumulus castellanus in that its vertical protuberances subtend an angle of more than 1° when observed at an angle of more than 30° above the horizon. When altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus attain a considerable vertical development, they become cumulus congestus and often develop into cumulonimbus.

The cryosphere exerts an important influence on Earth’s climate, owing to its high surface reflectivity (albedo). This property gives it the ability to reflect a large fraction of solar radiation back into space and influences how much solar energy is absorbed by land and oceans. Ice on land, in the form of ice sheets and glaciers, plays a further important role in the Earth system through its ability to store vast amounts of water away from the oceans for long periods of time. Any change in the ice volume stored on land, as ice sheets and glaciers grow or shrink, has a direct impact on global mean sea level. As the climate changes, the cryosphere changes with it and, through feedback processes, these changes have an influence on the climate. For example, the increased melting of snow and ice caused by a warming planet enables more solar energy to be absorbed by land or water, which in turn leads to more warming. This is also known as the snow- or ice-albedo feedback.",

          "text": "Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a geometric technique: it measures the time difference between the arrival at two Earth-based antennas of a radio wavefront emitted by a distant quasar. Using large numbers of time difference measurements from many quasars observed with a global network of antennas, VLBI determines the inertial reference frame defined by the quasars and simultaneously the precise positions of the antennas. Because the time difference measurements are precise to a few picoseconds, VLBI determines the relative positions of the antennas to a few millimeters and the quasar positions to fractions of a milliarcsecond. Since the antennas are fixed to the Earth, their locations track the instantaneous orientation of the Earth in the inertial reference frame.The celestial reference frame is defined by VLBI. The International Astronomical Union has adopted over 3,400 extragalactic radio sources (mostly quasars) used by VLBI as the defining objects of the celestial reference frame. Extragalactic objects form a true inertial reference frame because they are at such great distances that their motions across the sky are undetectable. Positions of stars in our galaxy are now tied to this reference frame, and this is the same reference frame used for measuring Earth orientation. VLBI is unique in its ability to make rapid, accurate measurements of the orientation of the terrestrial reference frame with respect to the celestial reference frame.VLBI observations are sponsored by over 40 organizations located in 19 countries. VLBI determines with unequaled accuracy the terrestrial reference frame (antenna locations on the Earth), the celestial reference frame (quasar positions on the sky), and Earth's orientation in space.",

A cold wave is a weather event involving a cooling of the air, or the invasion of very cold air, over a large area. It is marked by a drop of average temperature well below the averages of a region. Cold waves can have negative impacts on people, crops, properties, and services. They can be preceded or accompanied by significant winter weather events, such as blizzards or ice storms. And they can feel even colder during periods of high winds.",

It does not usually\nextend farther than a few degrees south of the equator, but\noccasionally it does penetrate beyond 12 degrees S, displacing the\nrelatively cold Peru Current. The effects of this phenomenon are\ngenerally short-lived, and fishing is only slightly\ndisrupted. Occasionally (in 1891, 1925, 1941, 1957 - 58, 1965, 1972 -\n73, 1976, and 1982 - 83), the effects are major and prolonged. Under\nthese conditions, sea surface temperatures rise along the coast of\nPeru and in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean and may remain high\nfor more than a year, having disastrous effects on marine life and\nfishing. Excessive rainfall and flooding occur in the normally dry\ncoastal area of western tropical South America during these\nevents. Some oceanographers and meteorologists consider only the\nmajor, prolonged events as El Nino phenomena rather than the annually\noccurring weaker and short-lived ones. The name was originally applied\nto the latter events because of their occurrence at Christmas time.\n('http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/glossary.html')\n<p>\nInteracting parts of a single global system of climate\nfluctuations. ENSO is the most prominent known source of interannual\nvariability in weather and climate around the world, though not all\nareas are affected. The Southern Oscillation (SO) is a global-scale\nseesaw in atmospheric pressure between Indonesia/North Australia, and\nthe southeast Pacific. In major warm events El Nino warming extends\nover much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SO\npattern. Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are\ndeveloping countries with economies that are largely dependent upon\ntheir agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food\nsupply, employment, and foreign exchange. New capabilities to predict\nthe onset of ENSO event can have a global impact. While ENSO is a\nnatural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or\nfrequency may change as a result of global warming is an important\nconcern.\nFrom: 'http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/glossary.php3'",

They are found along the seaward margin of most\nabyssal plains and originate from the spreading of mid-ocean ridges. As such,\nthey usually form two strips parallel to mid-ocean ridges. They generally\ndecrease in height as one traverses away from the ridges as they gradually\nbecome covered with sediment and are replaced by abyssal plains.\nABYSSAL PLAINS: Flat areas of the ocean basin floor which slope less than 1\npart in 1000. These were formed by turbidity currents which covered the\npreexisting topography. Most abyssal plains are located between the base of thecontinental rise and the abyssal hills. The remainder are trench abyssal plainsthat lie in the bottom of deep-sea trenches. This latter type traps all\nsediment from turbidity currents and prevents abyssal plains from forming\nfurther seaward, e.g. much of the Pacific Ocean floor.",

Depending on the temperature of evaporation andhow far the water has had to travel before it fell as snow, the ratio of 18O to16O will vary. This ratio, known as d18O, can be measured very accurately usinga mass spectrometer. Over short time scales the change in temperature fromsummer to winter produces a very clear oscillation in the 18O/16O ratio. Thisoscillation is used to determine the age of the core at different depths,simply by counting the oscillations. Over longer time periods, this ratioindicates the average temperature of the regions between the evaporation siteand the coring site. Investigators in Greenland and Antarctica are alsoanalyzing for the ratio of 1H/2H (Hydrogen to deuterium) which will allow evenfiner detail about source temperature and condensation history to be obtained.",

It also exists below ground—as groundwater, in wells and aquifers. Water vapor is most visible as clouds and fog.The frozen part of Earth's hydrosphere is made of ice: glaciers, ice caps and icebergs. The frozen part of the hydrosphere has its own name, the cryosphere. Water moves through the hydrosphere in a cycle. Water collects in clouds, then falls to Earth in the form of rain or snow. This water collects in rivers, lakes and oceans. Then it evaporates into the atmosphere to start the cycle all over again. This is called the water cycle.'",

A cloud species the elements of which have the form of more or less isolated, generally smooth lenses or almonds; the outlines are sharp and sometimes show irisation.These clouds appear most often in formations of orographic origin, the result of lee waves, in which cases they remain nearly stationary with respect to the terrain (standing cloud), but they also occur in regions without marked orography. This species is found mainly in the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and (rarely) stratocumulus. Altocumulus lenticularis differs from cirrocumulus lenticularis in that, when smooth and without elements, it has shadowed parts while the latter is very white throughout. When undulated or subdivided, the altocumulus species differs from stratocumulus lenticularis in that its elements subtend an angle of less than 5° when viewed at an angle of more than 30° above the horizon.",

Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key characteristics of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that they use or affect the climate system (e.g., atmosphere, land, or ocean) globally or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects that cross national boundaries. Geoengineering is different from weather modification and ecological engineering, but the boundary can be fuzzy.",

However, compared to mesoscale eddies, they remain poorly studied due to technical difficulties in observing these small-scale and ephemeral ocean features. Satellite altimeters typically cannot characterize eddies smaller than 100–200 km in diameter. In subtropical and tropical oceans sea surface temperature imagery lose their spatial contrast during summer, and satellite ocean color imagery also suffer to lack of sufficient observations due to clouds, strong sun glint, and stray light (Chen et al., 2019; Hu, 2011). As a result, to date, there is generally a lack of synoptic and long-term characterization of submesoscale eddies in the world's oceans, except perhaps in some small regions when continuous land-based high frequency-radar observations are available.",

For the case of a change in solar irradiance (i.e., 'solar forcing'), the radiative forcing is simply the change in the average amount of solar energy absorbed per square meter of the Earth's area. Since the cross-sectional area of the Earth exposed to the sun (πr2) is equal to 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth (4πr2), the solar input per unit area is one quarter the change in solar intensity. This must be multiplied by the fraction of incident sunlight that is absorbed, F=(1-R), where R is the reflectivity, or albedo, of the Earth, equal to approximately 0.7. Thus, the solar forcing is the change in the solar intensity divided by 4 and multiplied by 0.7.",

The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.The reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country’s development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals.",

Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10–30%) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments.",

The desaturases are characterized by the presence of three conserved histidine tracks which are presumed to compose the Fe-binding active centers of the enzymes. Recent findings on the structure and expression of different types of fatty acid desaturase in cyanobacteria, plants and animals are reviewed in this article. Roles of individual desaturases in temperature acclimation and principles of regulation of the desaturase genes are discussed.",

The cumuliform cloud elements generally have a common base and usually seem to be arranged in lines. The species is found only in the genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Cirrus castellanus differs from cirrocumulus castellanus in that its vertical protuberances subtend an angle of more than 1° when observed at an angle of more than 30° above the horizon. When altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus attain a considerable vertical development, they become cumulus congestus and often develop into cumulonimbus.

Development of a vulnerability index for the environment which could be calculated on the scale of entire states for the purpose of ranking them and providing a single-figure expression of their relative environmental vulnerabilities. This work was done in response to a call made in the Barbados Plan of Action, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and an increasing awareness that small island developing states face disadvantages to their development associated with their remoteness, small size, dispersion, economic conditions, and limited natural resources. In the past vulnerability indices have been developed which describe the risks associated with economic and social conditions, climate change, sea-level rise, natural disasters and anthropogenic impacts. Most of these indices describe the vulnerability of human systems; there have been very limited attempts to describe effects on the environment. Human systems and the environment are dependent on one another so that risks to the environment of a state will eventually translate into risks to humans. This is the first attempt to construct an index that focuses on the vulnerability of the environment. An Environmental Vulnerability Index (the EVI) was constructed, based on a theoretical framework that identified three aspects of vulnerability: risks to the environment (natural and anthropogenic), the innate ability of the environment to cope with the risks (resilience) and ecosystem integrity (the health or condition of the environment as a result of past impacts). These three aspects correspond to three sub-indices, the REI, IRI and EDI, which are the Risk Exposure sub-Index, Intrinsic Resilience sub-Index and Environmental Degradation sub- Index respectively. The EVI was calculated as a weighted average of scores allocated in the range of 0-7 derived from a total of 57 indicators. A preliminary EVI was calculated for three countries, Australia, Fiji and Tuvalu. The preliminary EVI value for Tuvalu was the highest of the three countries indicating that its environment is the most vulnerable. The score obtained for Fiji was intermediate in value, and that for Australia was the lowest, though the difference between Fiji and Australia was relatively smaller than that between Fiji and Tuvalu. There were similar levels of risk in each of the countries, the most degradation in Australia and the least intrinsic resilience in Tuvalu. These results, though promising are only preliminary because the EVI requires refinement and there was insufficient time to collect all of the required data from all of the countries and because there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the data. We expect that each of these problems can be overcome. The EVI developed here will require further refinement before it becomes fully operational. The results show that it is possible to obtain a single figure measure of vulnerability and that data which were previously thought to be difficult to obtain can be obtained. The methodology selected in the computation of the index can produce results which could have operational usefulness for ranking countries according to their environmental vulnerabilities. It is envisaged that the EVI would be recalculated every 5 years to provide updates on the vulnerability status of countries. This index highlights the need for governments to upgrade their collection and collation of environmental statistics. In addition, the breakdown of results into meteorological, geological, anthropogenic, and other categories of risk highlights areas of concern for environmental action.",

Sea water contains many isotopes of oxygen, the most common being 18O to 16O. During cold periods the glaciers grow, water is drawn up into them, and the proportion of 18O increases. When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive. Using this data a series of at least eleven cycles of cooling and warming climatic conditions have been recognized in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene.",

In the troposphere ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric (H2SO4), nitric (HNO3) to form fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [Malm et al., 2004]. These ammonium (NH4+) containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation [Adams et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2004; Henze et al., 2012] and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei [Abbatt et al., 2006]. PM2.5 endangers public health by penetrating the human respiratory systems, depositing in the lungs and alveolar regions [Pope et al., 2002], and causing premature mortality [Lelieveld et al., 2015]. A precursor of these inorganic aerosols, gaseous NH3 is often the limiting species in their formation [Wang et al., 2013; Lelieveld et al., 2015]. Excess reactive nitrogen reduces biodiversity and causes harmful algal blooms and anoxic conditions. Dry deposition of gaseous ammonia may have substantially greater adverse impacts on ecosystem health than deposition of ammonium in aerosols or precipitation [Sheppard et al., 2011]. In contrast, PM2.5 has greater impact on human morbidity and mortality. In this article we quantify recent (~14 year) increases in tropospheric ammonia and suggest likely causes for these trends.",

Bromine is many times more effective at destroying ozone than chlorine. At the time the current U.S. tax code was adopted, the ozone depletion potentials of halon 1301 and halon 1211 were observed to be 10 and 3, respectively. These values are used for tax calculations.

Microfossils are a heterogeneous bunch of fossil remains studied as a single discipline because rock samples must be processed in certain ways to remove them and microscopes must be used to study them. Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. Microfossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.",

The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance thegreenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing tothe warming of Earth's lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory)\nThe most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrationsfor periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gasinclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widelyaccepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicatethat atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260¿280uL/L immediately beforeindustrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during thepreceding 10,000 years. \nThe longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has beensampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 yearsbefore the present. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxideconcentration has varied between 180¿210 uL/L during ice ages, increasing to280¿300 uL/L during warmerinterglacials.(http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Carbon-dioxide)",

Earlier definitions also included a condition of low temperatures, on the order of -7°C (20°F) or lower, or -12°C (10°F) or lower (severe blizzard). The name originated in the United States but it is also used in other countries. In the Antarctic the name is given to violent autumnal winds off the ice cap. In southeastern France, the cold north wind with snow is termed blizzard (see also boulbie).Similar storms in Russian Asia are the buran and purga. In popular usage in the United States and in England, the term is often used for any heavy snowstorm accompanied by strong winds.",

Whilst a long-term natural process, it may be exacerbated by global warming. This results in a positive feedback effect, as methane is itself a powerful greenhouse gas. The feedback of the undisturbed process is comparably weak, however, because the local release leads to a warming spread over the whole globe.The Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane.[1] Global warming may accelerate its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass.[2] Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as submarine clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming.[3][4] Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.[5]",

          "text": "Refers to an environmental vulnerability index for Fiji. Development of a vulnerability index for the environment which could be calculated on the scale of entire states for the purpose of ranking them and providing a single-figure expression of their relative environmental vulnerabilities. This work was done in response to a call made in the Barbados Plan of Action, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and an increasing awareness that small island developing states face disadvantages to their development associated with their remoteness, small size, dispersion, economic conditions, and limited natural resources. In the past vulnerability indices have been developed which describe the risks associated with economic and social conditions, climate change, sea-level rise, natural disasters and anthropogenic impacts. Most of these indices describe the vulnerability of human systems; there have been very limited attempts to describe effects on the environment. Human systems and the environment are dependent on one another so that risks to the environment of a state will eventually translate into risks to humans. This is the first attempt to construct an index that focuses on the vulnerability of the environment. An Environmental Vulnerability Index (the EVI) was constructed, based on a theoretical framework that identified three aspects of vulnerability: risks to the environment (natural and anthropogenic), the innate ability of the environment to cope with the risks (resilience) and ecosystem integrity (the health or condition of the environment as a result of past impacts). These three aspects correspond to three sub-indices, the REI, IRI and EDI, which are the Risk Exposure sub-Index, Intrinsic Resilience sub-Index and Environmental Degradation sub- Index respectively. The EVI was calculated as a weighted average of scores allocated in the range of 0-7 derived from a total of 57 indicators. A preliminary EVI was calculated for three countries, Australia, Fiji and Tuvalu. The preliminary EVI value for Tuvalu was the highest of the three countries indicating that its environment is the most vulnerable. The score obtained for Fiji was intermediate in value, and that for Australia was the lowest, though the difference between Fiji and Australia was relatively smaller than that between Fiji and Tuvalu. There were similar levels of risk in each of the countries, the most degradation in Australia and the least intrinsic resilience in Tuvalu. These results, though promising are only preliminary because the EVI requires refinement and there was insufficient time to collect all of the required data from all of the countries and because there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the data. We expect that each of these problems can be overcome. The EVI developed here will require further refinement before it becomes fully operational. The results show that it is possible to obtain a single figure measure of vulnerability and that data which were previously thought to be difficult to obtain can be obtained. The methodology selected in the computation of the index can produce results which could have operational usefulness for ranking countries according to their environmental vulnerabilities. It is envisaged that the EVI would be recalculated every 5 years to provide updates on the vulnerability status of countries. This index highlights the need for governments to upgrade their collection and collation of environmental statistics. In addition, the breakdown of results into meteorological, geological, anthropogenic, and other categories of risk highlights areas of concern for environmental action.",

This means that nine years out of ten a temperature as cold or colder than 32 degrees is expected to occur later than March 1 during the spring season. For the fall season, the probability level represents the chance of having a temperature as cold or colder earlier than the computed date. The freeze-free probability level indicates the chance of having a longer freeze-free period than the computed number of days. The methods used to compute the freeze probabilities come from two data distributions: a discrete freeze or no-freeze distribution, where a no-freeze annual season is one in which only one or no freeze occurs; and a continuous one of freeze dates for the years of freeze occurrence, where at least two distinct freeze dates occur in a year.",

Greenland, due to having a large and relatively stable deep ice sheet is often the target for drilling ice cores.Isotopic analysis of the ice in the core can be linked to temperature and global sea level variations. Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.While it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data. I attended a talk at ICCC 09 that showed one of the ice core operations had procedures that left significant contamination issues for CO2.

Fog formed when water vapor is added to air that is much colder than the vapor's source; most commonly, when very cold air drifts across relatively warm water.No matter what the nature of the vapor source (warm water, industrial combustion exhaust, exhaled breath), its equilibrium vapor pressure is greater than that corresponding to the colder air; thus, the water vapor, upon becoming mixed with and cooled by the cold air, rapidly condenses. It should be noted that this mechanism never allows the fog to actually reach the vapor source. Also, upon further mixing in sufficiently turbulent or convective flow (only a slight degree is needed), the fog particles evaporate at a more or less well defined upper limit of the fog. Note, also, that although advection of air is necessary to produce steam fog, it differs greatly from an advection fog in the usual sense, which is caused by warm, moist air moving over a cold surface. Steam fog is commonly observed over lakes and streams on cold autumn mornings as well as in polar regions. It is sometimes confused with ice fog, but its particles are entirely liquid. At temperatures below -29°C (-20°F), these may freeze into droxtals and create a type of ice fog that may be known as frost smoke.",

The cumuliform cloud elements generally have a common base and usually seem to be arranged in lines. The species is found only in the genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Cirrus castellanus differs from cirrocumulus castellanus in that its vertical protuberances subtend an angle of more than 1° when observed at an angle of more than 30° above the horizon. When altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus attain a considerable vertical development, they become cumulus congestus and often develop into cumulonimbus.

Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a\ntransformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation\nvalues follow a normal distribution.\nThe Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly\nexpress the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet\nconditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other\ntime scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to\ndecision-makers. Consequently, a separate SPI value is calculated for\na selection of time scales, covering the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months, and ending\non the last day of the latest month.",

Development of a vulnerability index for the environment which could be calculated on the scale of entire states for the purpose of ranking them and providing a single-figure expression of their relative environmental vulnerabilities. This work was done in response to a call made in the Barbados Plan of Action, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and an increasing awareness that small island developing states face disadvantages to their development associated with their remoteness, small size, dispersion, economic conditions, and limited natural resources. In the past vulnerability indices have been developed which describe the risks associated with economic and social conditions, climate change, sea-level rise, natural disasters and anthropogenic impacts. Most of these indices describe the vulnerability of human systems; there have been very limited attempts to describe effects on the environment. Human systems and the environment are dependent on one another so that risks to the environment of a state will eventually translate into risks to humans. This is the first attempt to construct an index that focuses on the vulnerability of the environment. An Environmental Vulnerability Index (the EVI) was constructed, based on a theoretical framework that identified three aspects of vulnerability: risks to the environment (natural and anthropogenic), the innate ability of the environment to cope with the risks (resilience) and ecosystem integrity (the health or condition of the environment as a result of past impacts). These three aspects correspond to three sub-indices, the REI, IRI and EDI, which are the Risk Exposure sub-Index, Intrinsic Resilience sub-Index and Environmental Degradation sub- Index respectively. The EVI was calculated as a weighted average of scores allocated in the range of 0-7 derived from a total of 57 indicators. A preliminary EVI was calculated for three countries, Australia, Fiji and Tuvalu. The preliminary EVI value for Tuvalu was the highest of the three countries indicating that its environment is the most vulnerable. The score obtained for Fiji was intermediate in value, and that for Australia was the lowest, though the difference between Fiji and Australia was relatively smaller than that between Fiji and Tuvalu. There were similar levels of risk in each of the countries, the most degradation in Australia and the least intrinsic resilience in Tuvalu. These results, though promising are only preliminary because the EVI requires refinement and there was insufficient time to collect all of the required data from all of the countries and because there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the data. We expect that each of these problems can be overcome. The EVI developed here will require further refinement before it becomes fully operational. The results show that it is possible to obtain a single figure measure of vulnerability and that data which were previously thought to be difficult to obtain can be obtained. The methodology selected in the computation of the index can produce results which could have operational usefulness for ranking countries according to their environmental vulnerabilities. It is envisaged that the EVI would be recalculated every 5 years to provide updates on the vulnerability status of countries. This index highlights the need for governments to upgrade their collection and collation of environmental statistics. In addition, the breakdown of results into meteorological, geological, anthropogenic, and other categories of risk highlights areas of concern for environmental action.",

For example, a character may be considered a desert adaptation because many desert-dwelling species possess the character, and non-desert-dwelling species do not. However, if there are many desert-dwelling species in a particular part of a clade, then this character may have evolved by chance alone. Select examples from tenebrionid beetles, lizards, birds, and mammals are considered.",

(There's no mystery about that: just add up the six atoms.) In water carbonic acid dissociates rapidly to form a H+ ion and HCO2 (bicarbonate), so it affects the carbonate equilibrium, and pH values change as a result. Dissolved CO2 lowers the average pH of rainwater to 5.7, even where 'acid rain' caused by pollution isn't a factor. The gentle acidity of rainwater is a major source for the weathering of minerals, which the carbonic acid leaches from rocks and which eventually find their way to the ocean.",

          "text": "The East Atlantic (EA) pattern is the second prominent mode of low-frequency variability over the North Atlantic, and appears as a leading mode in all months. The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a “southward shifted” NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).The positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.The EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004. The positive phase of the EA pattern was particularly strong and persistent during 1997-2004, when 3-month running mean values routinely averaged 1.0-2.0 standard deviations above normal.",

There are two main types of deep convection, the physics ofwhich are very different. The first is convection near an open boundary,which involves the formation of a dense water mass which reaches thebottom of the ocean by descending a continental slope. The second type isopen-ocean deep convection, where the sinking occurs far from land and ispredominantly vertical.",

While some rigid limits have been placed on the thickness of the layer concerned, it is more realistic to consider variable thicknesses.

Generally, four times the height of surface growth or structures defines the level where microclimatic overtones disappear.

Currently, the most studied broad types are the 'urban microclimate,' affected by pavement, buildings, air pollution, dense inhabitation, etc., the 'vegetation microclimate,' concerned with the complex nature of the air space occupied by vegetation, and its effects upon the vegetation (see phytoclimatology); and the microclimate of confined spaces (the cryptoclimate) of houses, greenhouses, caves, etc.",

SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.",

It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of minus numbers; for example, minus 2 is moderate drought, minus 3 is severe drought, and minus4 is extreme drought. The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculatingshort-term abnormal dryness or wetness affecting agriculture. CMI is designed to indicate normal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season; it uses the same levels as the Palmer Drought Index. It differs from the Palmer Index in that the formula places less weight on the data from previous weeks and more weight on the recent week.",

It was first applied to the winds over the Arabian Sea, which blow for six months from northeast and for six months from southwest, but it has been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world. Even in Europe the prevailing west to northwest winds of summer have been called the 'European monsoon.' The primary cause is the much greater annual variation of temperature over large land areas compared with neighboring ocean surfaces, causing an excess of pressure over the continents in winter and a deficit in summer, but other factors such as the relief features of the land have a considerable effect. The monsoons are strongest on the southern and eastern sides of Asia, the largest landmass, but monsoons also occur on the coasts of tropical regions wherever the planetary circulation is not strong enough to inhibit them. They have been described in Spain, northern Australia, Africa except the Mediterranean, Texas, and the western coasts of the United States and Chile. In India the term is popularly applied chiefly to the southwest monsoon and, by extension, to the rains which it brings.",

A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon.DORIS has been included as a host experiment on various space missions. Platforms with on-board DORIS receivers are CryoSat-2, HY-2A, OSTM/Jason-2, Jason-3, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, SARAL, and SPOT-4 and -5.Unlike many other navigation systems, DORIS is based on an uplink device. The receivers are on board the satellite while the transmitters are on the ground. This creates a centralized system in which the complete set of observations is downloaded by the satellite to the ground center, from where they are distributed after editing and processing.",

          "text": "Thunder hours represent a historical measure of lightning occurrence and a metric of thunderstorm frequency that is comparatively less sensitive to geographic variations in the detection capabilities of a lightning location system. Thunder hours can be calculated for the entire globe using ground-based detection networks (DiGangi et al. 2022) or satellite-based systems (Cecil et al. 2015). These datasets offer a way to observe long-term trends of lightning across the diurnal cycle. Thunder hours can be developed from multiple lightning observation systems where at the temporal and spatial scale used, the various differences in observational techniques are mitigated. Thunder hour datasets are being produced for the World Meteorological Organization to provide an easy to produce, long-term, global lightning observations.\n\nThe DiGangi et al. (2022) abstract states that thunder hours are an intuitive measure of thunderstorm frequency where the 1-h interval corresponds to the life-span of most thunderstorms, and the hourly temporal resolution of the data also represents long-lived systems well. Flash-density-observing systems are incredibly useful, but they have some drawbacks that limit how they can be used to quantify global thunderstorm activity on a climatological scale: flash density distributions derived from satellite observations must sacrifice a great deal of their spatial resolution in order to capture the diurnal convective cycle, and the detection efficiencies of ground-based lightning detection systems are not uniform in space or constant in time. Examining convective patterns in the context of thunder hours lends insight into thunderstorm activity without being heavily influenced by network performance, making thunder hours particularly useful for studying thunderstorm climatology.",
